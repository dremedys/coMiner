        "\n        Python bindings to a JavaScript environment\n      .Python bindings to ., enabling you to send requests and data\nfrom your python process to a performant JavaScript environment..There are a variety of libraries which provide low-level access to JS engines - PyExecJS et al - but they\ntend to suffer from limited functionality and poor performance. Rather than relying on basic evaluation\nof JavaScript, this library enables you to configure a persistent JS processes which responds to data sent\nfrom your python process..To reduce the cost of integrating yet another technology, a . process is provided\nwhich can automatically spawn js-host instances in the background..js-host requires access to a . or . binary..On OSX, you can run .. On Linux, you can install node with your package manager..Create a . file with.Install the . JavaScript library with.Create a file named . and insert.Open a python shell and run.If everything went ok, you should see some output as the manager process spins up and then spawns a host\nwhich uses your . file..In the same python shell, run.Settings can be defined by importing . and calling the . method\nwith keyword arguments matching the setting that you want to define. For example.If you are using js-host in a Django project, add . to your .And configure js-host by placing a dictionary named . into your settings files.An absolute path to the directory which contains your node_modules directory..Default: .A path to the default config file used for hosts and managers..If the path is relative, it is appended to ...Default: .Indicates that a manager should be used to spawn host instances..DO . USE THE MANAGER IN PRODUCTION..Default: .A path to a . binary..Default: .A path to the . binary used to control hosts and managers..If the path is relative, it is appended to the SOURCE_ROOT setting.Default: .Indicates how many seconds . objects will wait for a response before\nraising exceptions..Default: .Indicates that once this library has been configured, it should attempt to connect to a\nhost..This setting enables any config or connection errors to be raised during startup rather\nthan runtime. It also enables connections to managed hosts to be preserved between\nrestarts of your python process..If you want to run multiple hosts and/or control the connection process, set this to\n., but be aware that managed hosts may not preserve connections when your python\nprocess restarts..Default: .Overrides the root url which requests are sent to. By default, the root url is inferred from\nthe config that the host generates from your config file and the js-host defaults..If you want to route requests manually to a host, set it to a string such as\n...Default: .Indicates how much information the host should print the terminal. By default the library\nwill print to the terminal whenever processes are started or connected to..If you want to suppress all output, set it to ...Default: .In development, you can take advantage of the manager process to abstract away the overhead of\nstarting and stopping processes. To use a manager to spawn hosts, set the . setting\nto ...If you are writing functions that are on a host, you are recommended to start hosts manually, as\nit will provide more immediate feedback, as well as easier control of a process. To start a host\nmanually, refer to ...In a production environment, you are strongly recommended to . use the manager.\nEnsure that the . setting is set to . before you start your python process..In a production environment, you should run your hosts under a supervisor system, such as\n. or .. You can refer\nto . for the necessary\nincantation to spin up a process. It will generally boil down to something like.By default, js-host instances will only write their logs to stdout and stderr. To log to files,\nrefer to js-host's ...js-host does not have its own caching layer, but an upstream caching layer can be implemented\neasily. All communication between the python processes and the js-host processes is performed\nvia HTTP, so placing a reverse proxy such as . between\nthe two can massively boost the performance of your requests..By default, the python layer will infer a host's url from the host's config. If you want to route\nall requests through another address, define the . setting. For example.The python layer will now send all requests through ., rather than connecting\ndirectly to the host..Requests are sent to hosts according to js-host's\n...When the python layer sends requests to functions, it appends a . paramater to the url\nwhich is a . hash of the serialized data sent to the function. For example, a request to a\nfunction named . with the data . will be sent as:.This url convention enables you to easily cache a specific function's output by the data that\nwas sent in.. objects enable you to pass data from your python process to a JavaScript\nenvironment. Functions must be instantiated with a string which matches a name specified in your config\nfile..If your . file resembled the following.You can call those functions from Python with the following.Keyword arguments provided to . are passed to the host as JSON. The host deserializes the\ndata sent, and then passes the data to your function as its first argument. The second argument\nto your function is a callback which allows you to pass data back to the python process..Your functions can complete their task either synchronously or asynchronously. Once the callback\nhas been called, the host assumes that the function has completed and sends a response back to\nthe Python process..Functions will lazily bind to the . singleton unless you override the function's .\n...For more information on the API and behaviour of functions, refer to the js-host's\n... objects read in your config files and act as bridges to JavaScript environments generated\nfrom your config files..If you want to introspect a host, there are some utils provided.If you are using the manager to control your hosts, the following utils are also available. objects provide an interface to a detached process which runs\non your local network and can spawn . instances on\ndemand..The primary benefit of using a manager is that it abstracts away the bother of spawning a host\nmanually. During development, your primary goal is to build things - issues regarding stability\nand logging should be left to production environments..To allow a manager to spawn instances automatically, set the . setting to ...If you are writing functions to be used on hosts, be aware that manually starting hosts will provide\neasier access to the hosts output streams and debugging functionality. Refer to\n. to manually start a host..Note: managers should only ever be used in development environments. Do . use the manager\nin production. Please refer to the . section before\nconfiguring your environment..Managers are spun up via a child process of your python process. The child process blocks python\nuntil the manager has been spawned in a third process which is completely detached from python.\nUsing a detached process allows the manager and its hosts to persist even when your python process\nhas restarted or exited..Once a manager is running, it starts listening for incoming requests which indicate that your\npython process wants it to spawn a new js-host using a particular config file. Once the new\ninstance has been spawned, the python process asks the manager to register a new connection\nto the host..When your python process exits, it sends a disconnect signal to the manager, notifying it\nthat any hosts spawned by your python process are no longer required. When a spawned host no\nlonger has ony open connections, the manager waits for 5 seconds to allow any new connections\nto be opened. If the time period expires and no new connections have been opened, the manager\nwill stop the host's process..When all of a manager's hosts have been disconnected and stopped, the manager will stop its own\nprocess. This enables the manager to clean up after itself, and prevents rogue processes from\nrunning in the background..The connect/disconnect method enables your python process to hook in to persistent JS environments\nwhich survive even when your python has restarted. Maintaining persistent environments enables\nyou to integrate JS technologies which have a high startup cost that should only be incurred\nonce. A typical use-case where this optimisation provides massive performance improvements is\nintegrating a compiler - such as webpack or browserify - which have a sizable startup overhead\nas they parse all of your files..Be aware that managers introduce some behaviour that you should be aware of:.Python processes will connect to managed hosts based on the path to your config file. If you\nopen a python shell which triggers a connection to a host, the manager will not stop the host\nuntil your shell has exited..If you are running a server and a python shell which have both connected to the same host, the\nmanager will not stop the host until both processes have exited..Managed hosts can continue running after their config file has changed..To force a restart, call the . method of a managed . instance. For example.Managers and managed hosts run in processes detached from your shell, which can make it difficult\nto inspect their output streams..To provide some measure of introspection, managed hosts write their output to logfiles which are\nstored in your temporary directory. The . attribute of a . instance provides an\nabsolute path to the file. For example.If a managed host encounters an unhandled exception, the host will crash and the python process\nwill raise errors until the host is respawned. By design, hosts will not respawn until you have\nrestarted the python process..Preventing automatic respawning of crashed hosts simply hides the underlying issue, and makes it\ndifficult to reason about a system's state..If a crash is detected, exceptions will be raised indicating that you should consult the host's\nlogfile to inspect the stack traces produced during the unhandled exception..If you want to inspect the log output of a managed host, a path to the host's logfile is accessible via.The following one liner will start (or connect to) a managed host and then . its logfile..\n      Python bindings to a JavaScript environment\n    ",

Dartanalyzer is able to catch many types of errors, like: missing functions, invalid names, calling a function with the wrong argument types.  The quality of the analysis will depend on how much type information can be\ninferred from your code, combined with the variables you have manually typed.  If dartanalyzer detects an error in your code, translation will abort, and debugging information is printed..PythonJS gives you the option to optimize your program for speed with a new syntax for static typing, in some cases this results in code that is 20X faster.\nA variable can be statically typed as: int, float, long, str, list, or dict..\nThe translator then uses this type information to speed up runtime checks and method calls.\nIn the example below . and . are typed as ...The . type is accurate up to 53bits, if you need true 64bit integer math you can use the . type.

        "\n            Ever wondered how to send data between two programming languages? Ever tried to send an object or multiple pieces of data?\n    .\n            Today I'll be showing you how to use JSON to send data from JavaScript to Python. I'll be covering how to setup a web server, along with all the code you need.\n    .\n            You will need a few things to get started with this project. I'll be running on Mac, which has Python installed already. You should be able to follow along reasonably well using Linux. If you are using Windows, you will need to . and install Python, and maybe brush up on your ..\n    .\n            You will need ., a package manager for Python. This is installed by default with Python versions greater than 2.7.9.\n    .\n            You need a server to . Python to a web page. There are many options for this. If you have a server setup already, you can skip this step.\n    .\n            There are many options you could use here. . is a good choice, as is . (I have written about Twisted before for a .). I'll be using . for this project.\n    .\n            Install Flask using pip (via the command line):\n    .\n            That's it! There are a few options to setup, but providing it installed correctly, you are good to go.\n    .\n            You may wish to consider using a ., however this is entirely optional.\n    .\n            Create a new file in your favorite text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE). I'm using . and ., but use whatever you are comfortable with.\n    .\n            Now perform some initial setup of Flask:\n    .\n            This imports the required modules and configures your app. Now set up a .:\n    .\n            This configures a ., which is like a page of a website. This may sometimes be called an . or a ..\n    .\n            The . line defines a . or . called ., which will run whenever this endpoint is called. These methods do not have to use the same name as the endpoint -- call it any suitable name. Inside this method is a simple . string. Finally, setup your script to actually run when it is requested:\n    .\n            Go ahead and save this script as . in a suitable location. Go back to your Terminal and navigate to your project folder. Run the script:\n    .\n            The word . is used to tell the computer that the following file should be run as a Python script. The filename afterwards is the name of the file you wish to run as Python. If everything works correctly, you should see a status message in the Terminal:\n    .\n            This shows you the IP address your server is running on, as well as the port. These will be . and .. You can press . > . to stop this running, but don't do that just yet.\n    .\n            Enter the address into your browser, and you should see . appear on the screen. You have now successfully setup a Python server and written your first script! You will need to restart the server (stop the script, then run it again) if you make any changes.\n    .\n            If you wish to view your scripts on a different computer on the same network, change . to:\n    .\n            There are two parts to this line. The first tells Flask to serve files on your local IP address (make sure you keep this as ., even though that is not your IP address). The second part specifies the port. You can change the port if you wish to. Run the script again (remember to save and restart).\n    .\n            You should now be able to access your scripts from a different computer on the same network. Make sure to use your IP address (run . in the command line) and the port you entered previously. You may need to configure your . if you are using one.\n    .\n            The console will show you the HTTP response, and IP address of any device that connects to your server:\n    .\n            Notice how the endpoint . returned a 404 error? The endpoint is not setup! If you wish to access this over the internet, look into ..\n    .\n            Now that your server is all setup, it's time to write some templates. You will use JSON to send data between Python and Javascript, and templates facilitate this. We have written about . in the past, so go read up if you are not sure.\n    .\n            You will need to use a templating language. . comes with Flask, so there is no extra setup needed.\n    .\n            A templating language works in conjunction with a web server. It takes the output of your Python scripts (the back-end code), and makes it easy to output to the user using HTML (the front-end). It's important to note that templates should . be used for logic! Keep the logic in Python, and use templates . for displaying the data. It gets very messy if you start trying to get complex with the template.\n    .\n            Create a folder inside your project directory called .. Flask recognizes files inside this folder as template files. Don't place any Python scripts in here, this is where you can put your HTML files.\n    .\n            Create a file called .. Inside it, place the following code:\n    .\n            This is the way to access a piece of data called ., which will be found inside your scripts. Go back to your .. script, and modify the . function. Instead of returning ., enter this code:\n    .\n            This will load the . file you created earlier, and substitute the . template tag for the string .. You can use this method to load any page inside your template folder, and pass them any amount of data.\n    .\n            Now that you know how templates work, here's the full HTML code you need. Paste this inside your . file:\n    .\n            Notice how this does not include CSS, or any HTML headers. These are required for webpages (this example will work without them), so look into these at . if you care to.\n    .\n            There is not too much going on in this file. A JSON list of rally cars is setup. There is a bit of text and a button. When the button is pressed, . is used to . the list of cars to the server. This will go to the . endpoint, which you will create next. Make sure you read our . if you want to learn more about how that is working in this context.\n    .\n            Here's the code you need for .:\n    .\n            This code defines two endpoints. The default one (.) serves the previous html page. When the button is pressed, a . request is made to the . endpoint. The second part of the route definition (.) defines how this page can be accessed. As . is the only way specified, this route will deny any other http requests (such as .).\n    .\n            This . endpoint simply loops over every JSON row, and appends the car make to a string, which then gets returned after the loop. The JSON is stored in the . variable, and as the . was used, Python is aware that this is a JSON object. The . variable inside the . can be thought of like a row of data. Different elements of each row can be accessed by using their name in square brackets (.).\n    .\n            Open your browser developer tools (. > . > . on Mac OS/Chrome), and navigate to the . tab. Press the button, and you should see the server response appear:\n    .\n            Try modifying the initial JSON and see what happens. Let's modify the Python to do . different, depending on the JSON. Here's the new code you need for the .:\n    .\n            This uses a simple if statement to change the output, depending on the input. You could easily adapt this to write to a database, or run a different piece of code. Here's what it looks like now:\n    .\n            You should now have a solid understanding of how to setup a Python server, and how you can respond to JSON requests.\n    .\n            Do you enjoy coding in JavaScript?

Yes, of course.are solutions you write in ASM or C 10-20 times faster than anything.written in an interpreted language. Yes, they are smaller and more.elegant. But why are the demands of the market for ASM or C developers.decreasing now, and if you look at job adverts, most jobs are for a.higher level language....Because it is just a lot more productive writing code in Python or.Ruby or even Java, than doing it in plain C or even Assembler. Yes,.with some good libraries, you can speed up the development process in.C quite a bit, but it still isn't as fast as going with a language.like Python in the first place (at least that is what my experience.suggests)..Still, there are things which are absolutely viable to implement in C,.and either use them as a library, or just glue them together in a.higher language.....And if you translate that onto a JS code generator, I think that that.might be a route we possibly will see: Prototype and develop your.stuff in one of the higher level abstraction tools (like GWT or.pyjamas), and only handtune or handwrite the real critial stuff in.direct JS..It might work *shrug*.But, as I said, I haven't yet really played around with any of those.toolkits, but I definitely want to give it a try :).Jens.This make really sense but applied from a lower level language to a.higher level one. You don't write a Haskell code generator in Erlang.because you feel more comfortable using the Erlang toolset and VM. You.write in Haskell because you need/like Haskell. Despite some people.think.JavaScript is not a bad language, is the world around it that is not.as good as we'd like it to be..But JavaScript is the heart of the scripting of many browsers and it's.a dynamic language at the same level as Python, Ruby or whatever. I.think that the best way to learn and develop in JavaScript is to learn.it, master it, read about it, experiment with it, get a library for it.and so on. You notice how many times I used *it* and not \"something.else\" :D ?.Pyjamas (and GWT) is a fine idea but in my opinion has been conceived.for the wrong reasons.",

        "Anatella offers an abstraction layer around the code that allows business analysts and coders to communicate smoothly and make progress in a collaborative way. Thanks to the abstraction layer, the analysts don’t see any line of code while the coders are still writing code. Both groups can still think together and bring meaningful contributions on how to solve the problem at hand. TIMi is the only tool to provide an abstraction layer above your R/Python/JS code..We initially built Anatella for the very experienced data scientists, with dozens of years of experience in data science. Indeed, experienced data scientists (such as ourselves!) know that their time is better spent understanding the data, rather than writing again and again the same code to plot charts, run a regression, etc. Thereafter, we noticed that both the very experienced data scientists and the business analysts enjoy the rich set of code-free features offered by Anatella. This is why we focused on creating a development platform for R/Python/JS that is (almost) code-free, and tailored for the citizen data scientists. .The idea is to avoid wasting the data scientist time in writing R/Python/JS code, unless it’s absolutely necessary, and when code is written, it is for the purpose of improving existing processes, or deploying innovation across the organization..While many other solutions offer node creation functionalities, these are typically not accessible to “non-programmers”. Anatella is the only platform built for the citizen data scientist in mind, and the idea is to let them deploy their code, control versions, get inspired and create new solutions. .Thanks to Anatella, many organization have seen a revolutionary change in the way they apprehend data: i.e. They have now adopted a striving analytical culture all around the company with many citizen data scientists enjoying to look at the data to solve the most complex business problems..There are three levels of R/Python/JS script repositories:.Each company can become a global R&D Department, supervised by a group of experts who centralize and control the diffusion of innovation!",

        "Is it possible to run both Python and Javascript code from the same project, e.g. run a Node and Flask server on different ports maybe?.That’s a really cool question – can you give some more detail about what you’re trying to do, or how the scripts would interact with each other?.Hey ., like . I’d love to hear more about what you’re trying to do..Glitch project’s only allow external traffic on a single port so you won’t be able to expose both a Node server and a Flask server to the internet - only one of those can run on the port Glitch is listening for (typically 3000, but it can change and - in Node - . will always have the right value provided you don’t overwrite that information)..If you wanted to have Flask running some sort of internal API, for example, it could run on some other port that would be available . for Node to access, or vice versa. You might also be able to do something like what’s discussed in . to expose both servers by proxying requests through Node to Flask..Hope this helps!.Hi . and .! Thanks for the information, I didn’t know projects only ever had one port exposed. In that case I probably couldn’t do what I wanted? But here’s what I’m trying to do anyway:.So my Javascript side is my frontend, where people can log in with Google authentication. But my Python side (backend) also needs Google authentication for it to make Google API calls. I’m using the . for the API calls which has 2 auth methods, either opening a new browser tab with the sign-in flow (which I use) or entering information into the command line, both which require manual user interaction..What I wanted to do is, if there weren’t any cached credentials already, or the user signed out, it can run the . authentication in a new browser tab, get the information it needs, then the JS side can sign in as the new user and run as normal..So far, I tried telling Flask to run on a different port:.And also had JS set up to invoke the Python code with an AJAX call:.but the project server kept hanging when it was trying to start up because it couldn’t actually run “node server.js && python3 server.py” for reasons you mentioned.. Could you link to your project? I think I see what you mean but want to make sure I’m understanding..My first thought (without having seen the code) is that you might not need that node server – if the Javascript is just the frontend (it’s only making that ajax call) would it be possible to serve the Javascript from flask, or am I missing something?.It sounds like a really cool project!.So, one other complexity here is that you may need to “manually” install your python requirements - Glitch will automatically make . work in the . of ., but if it’s there then it won’t do any boilerplate python setup. You could work around that by using a shell script that calls . as well as . in your package.json’s start script.. . Hi! Sorry I took so long to respond. I haven’t thought of serving the Javascript from Flask since I haven’t done anything like that before. .So far, I’ve set up an alternate solution for my app to avoid needing to use any local server authentication from the Python library, so I can simply have two separate projects running both the Python/JS sides that communicate with each other now. I think my main issue was not understanding how to use Google Auth as I needed in the first place..If I ever actually need to combine both languages in a project, however, I’ll be sure to check out the resources y’all linked!

MIT License. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. Python >=3.6\n  .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.Eel is a little Python library for making simple Electron-like offline HTML/JS GUI apps, with full access to Python capabilities and libraries..Eel is designed to take the hassle out of writing short and simple GUI applications. If you are familiar with Python and web development, probably just jump to . which picks random file names out of the given folder (something that is impossible from a browser)..There are several options for making GUI apps in Python, but if you want to use HTML/JS (in order to use jQueryUI or Bootstrap, for example) then you generally have to write a lot of boilerplate code to communicate from the Client (Javascript) side to the Server (Python) side..The closest Python equivalent to Electron (to my knowledge) is .. It is a bit heavy weight for what I wanted..Eel is not as fully-fledged as Electron or cefpython - it is probably not suitable for making full blown applications like Atom - but it is very suitable for making the GUI equivalent of little utility scripts that you use internally in your team..For some reason many of the best-in-class number crunching and maths libraries are in Python (Tensorflow, Numpy, Scipy etc) but many of the best visualization libraries are in Javascript (D3, THREE.js etc). Hopefully Eel makes it easy to combine these into simple utility apps for assisting your development..Join Eel's users and maintainers on ., if you like..Install from pypi with .:.To include support for HTML templating, currently using .:.An Eel application will be split into a frontend consisting of various web-technology files (.html, .js, .css) and a backend consisting of various Python scripts..All the frontend files should be put in a single directory (they can be further divided into folders inside this if necessary)..Suppose you put all the frontend files in a directory called ., including your start page ., then the app is started like this;.This will start a webserver on the default settings (.) and open a browser to ...If Chrome or Chromium is installed then by default it will open in that in App Mode (with the . cmdline flag), regardless of what the OS's default browser is set to (it is possible to override this behaviour)..Additional options can be passed to . as keyword arguments..Some of the options include the mode the app is in (e.g. 'chrome'), the port the app runs on, the host name of the app, and adding additional command line flags..As of Eel v0.12.0, the following options are available to .:.In addition to the files in the frontend folder, a Javascript library will be served at .. You should include this in any pages:.Including this library creates an . object which can be used to communicate with the Python side..Any functions in the Python code which are decorated with . like this.......will appear as methods on the . object on the Javascript side, like this....Similarly, any Javascript functions which are exposed like this....can be called from the Python side like this....The exposed name can also be overridden by passing in a second argument. If your app minifies JavaScript during builds, this may be necessary to ensure that functions can be resolved on the Python side:.When passing complex objects as arguments, bear in mind that internally they are converted to JSON and sent down a websocket (a process that potentially loses information)..See full example in: .Putting this together into a . example, we have a short HTML page, .:.and a short Python script .:.If we run the Python script (.), then a browser window will open displaying ., and we will see.......in the terminal, and.......in the browser console (press F12 to open)..You will notice that in the Python code, the Javascript function is called before the browser window is even started - any early calls like this are queued up and then sent once the websocket has been established..While we want to think of our code as comprising a single application, the Python interpreter and the browser window run in separate processes. This can make communicating back and forth between them a bit of a mess, especially if we always had to explicitly . values from one side to the other..Eel supports two ways of retrieving . from the other side of the app, which helps keep the code concise..To prevent hanging forever on the Python side, a timeout has been put in place for trying to retrieve values from\nthe JavaScript side, which defaults to 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds). This can be changed with the . parameter to .. There is no corresponding timeout on the JavaScript side..When you call an exposed function, you can immediately pass a callback function afterwards. This callback will automatically be called asynchrounously with the return value when the function has finished executing on the other side..For example, if we have the following function defined and exposed in Javascript:.Then in Python we can retrieve random values from the Javascript side like so:.(It works exactly the same the other way around)..In most situations, the calls to the other side are to quickly retrieve some piece of data, such as the state of a widget or contents of an input field. In these cases it is more convenient to just synchronously wait a few milliseconds then continue with your code, rather than breaking the whole thing up into callbacks..To synchronously retrieve the return value, simply pass nothing to the second set of brackets. So in Python we would write:.You can only perform synchronous returns after the browser window has started (after calling .), otherwise obviously the call with hang..In Javascript, the language doesn't allow us to block while we wait for a callback, except by using . from inside an . function. So the equivalent code from the Javascript side would be:.Eel is built on Bottle and Gevent, which provide an asynchronous event loop similar to Javascript. A lot of Python's standard library implicitly assumes there is a single execution thread - to deal with this, Gevent can \".\" many of the standard modules such as .. .. If you need monkey patching you should . and call . . you .. Monkey patching can interfere with things like debuggers so should be avoided unless necessary..For most cases you should be fine by avoiding using . and instead using the versions provided by .. For convenience, the two most commonly needed gevent methods, . and . are provided directly from Eel (to save importing . and/or . as well)..In this example.......we would then have three \"threads\" (greenlets) running;.If you want to package your app into a program that can be run on a computer without a Python interpreter installed, you should use ...Consult the . for more options..For Windows 10 users, Microsoft Edge (.) is installed by default and a useful fallback if a preferred browser is not installed.

It has been replaced by\nread-only properties in both Python and JavaScript that always accurately\nreport the current column names automatically. Setting . is\nno longer supported, however as this possibility has never been officially\ndocumented or demonstrated, it is not expected to affect any standard usage..Previously the default value, an empty list, corresponded to automatically\nchoosing all available renderers for hit testing. Now, a new default value\n. is used for that, so that an empty list can mean “hit test no\nrenderers”. A value of . may also be used to indicate no hit testing\nshould occur.

        "\nThis works. It is type-safe. I have not released it because I think it’s a bit… well, painful to use. I’m sure my implementation is a bit different from the one posted, but the key insights are:.1. You can write a variadic macro that figures out how many arguments it was passed in __VA_ARGS__,.2. You can use this variadic macro to paste the number of arguments into the name of another macro which is invoked using the ## preprocessor concatenation operator,.3. You can dispatch on the argument types using _Generic..The limitations are:.- You have to pick a maximum number of arguments and hard-code that maximum into your library (in order for #1 to work above)..- Macro-expansion makes the error messages a bit crazy and hard to read, like C++, but worse..- _Generic is rather user-hostile when there is an error..- Partitioning integral types with _Generic is probably the right way to do things. Unlike C++, there is no implicit casting. It is not obvious how to partition the integral types. I ended up using char, short, int, long, and long long, plus unsigned versions of each, and finally signed char (because char != signed char)..I will say that my version is probably a little more efficient at the call site, since it packs the argument types as bits into integer arguments. For example, it’s something like this:.\nSo the type information for up to 14 arguments is packed into one additional argument, on 64-bit systems. I use code generation for the macros to handle as many arguments as I like, and there is also 32-bit support..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.gcc's compile-time expression chooser is also severely limited compared to clang..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.It wasn’t added until Python 3.8 (f-strings were new in 3.6)..\n.\n.\n.It appears to work just fine there.  Though, once again I question my decision for a light-blue background for my terminal..\n.As for your terminal blue background it looks gorgeous, maybe you just need to tweak the palette a little bit to make sure at least 16 basic colors are contrast enough. Btw what is the meaning of :28 in your prompt? Is this amount of files changed or a revision number?.\n.The number is the number of revisions.  Helps me track how \"old\" different copies of the same repo is.  The star next to it denotes changes (in this case the a.out).The only other things this prompt does right now is show an error code if a command exits with one, and changes to \"can't miss it\" red when run as root.  For me, this is a minimal prompt, I oscillate between a lot more detail, and something closer to a standard installation..\n.Edit: looking more into it, the header is rather unhygienic: if I include print.h from multiple .c files I break ODR, which is undefined behavior. You have variable definitions in a header which is not good. You should guard those variables with a preprocessor define (something like DECLARE_PRINT_VARIABLES or similar) so I can then #define that to 1 in one and only one .c file and then we don’t break ODR..\n.[1] .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.In my header-only library I have different tricks to detect literal POD types. But portable. In your case unportable is fine..\n.\n.It is not a very elegant solution thanks to limitations of preprocessor __VAR_ARGS__. Basically there is a compiler builtin function __builtin_types_compatible_p() that checks if the argument is of a given type, then there is another builtin __builtin_choose_expr() that can do something with the result of the former. Using those two builtins I construct an array of type information and pass it to the actual printing function which is using <stdarg.h> and the array of type information to print stuff..\n.\n",

There is a vast variety of different AWS services for you out there. So here is where a question arises: .Amazon Web Services will let you access its scalable app and web servers on-demand as well as allow you to store and deliver your data, use its databases, search, cache, and other app services. Quite a lot of helpful features for you to use, isn’t it? So to make your choice easier we made a list of . that will combine well with Python and JS frameworks and help you build and run applications that provide a superb customer experience without having an operational overhead within your team..To begin with, let’s make an honorable mention of . (S3). It is the first AWS service everyone comes across when starting to work with Amazon. S3 is a storage for the internet that lets you store and fetch any amount of data of any format anytime, anywhere. This service offers outstanding security, scalability, performance, and data availability. Amazon S3 can be used together with other AWS services, including ., Amazon EBS, Amazon Glacier, and other storage repositories and gateways.. is an AWS service that lets you compute your code without having to use a server. With this service, your code can be executed for any type of backend service or apps. Lambda does all the compute resources managing, ., logging, capacity maintenance, and code controlling for you. There’s also a good feature that Lambda can offer you - . that gives you better control over the functioning of your serverless apps at any scale. You can apply Lambda to other services, like CloudWatch, DynamoDB, or S3 to build a mix of serverless, real-time data processing systems. Lambda is mostly used when building powerful mobile, web and IoT backends and for data processing like machine learning, real-time stream processing, or real-time file processing..DynamoDB is a NoSQL multi-active durable database service that provides you with stable performance even as it scales. You don’t have to overthink about software patching, setup and configuration, hardware provisioning, and all that stuff anymore. DynamoDB can also provide you with good encryption at Rest, which gets rid of complications and all the operational troubles when securing important data. This service is often used for building reusable responsive microservices and interactive web or mobile applications that have offline access, can be updated in real-time, and have data sync with built-in conflict resolution. Our team uses DynamoDB as a good alternative to . to ensure the best customer experience..Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Simple Queue Service (SQS) are messaging services for developers, provided by AWS. SNS is a fast, yet simple distributed publish-subscribe system that helps you with sending push notifications like SMS, emails, sqs, or HTTP endpoint to your users. SQS is a distributed queuing system that lets you decouple or integrate applications. You can receive, save, and send messages between software components at any capacity with no issues..AWS AppSync is a service that takes care of secure connections to data sources like Lambda, DynamoDB, and others to make it easy for you to create . APIs. This AWS service lets your apps relate to data from devices that are offline and helps you manage data from mobile apps in real-time between the device and the cloud. With AppSync, your apps will be able to provide real-time cooperative experiences in mobile applications and browsers even when a network connection is lost. .Amazon Cognito is a service that lets you add authorization, authentication, and user management to your apps. Identity pools and user pools are the two parts of Cognito that you can use together or separately. User pool lets your users sign up and sign in directly through this service or using a third party like Facebook, Google, etc. This service also synchronizes data so that your customers can still receive a superb user experience when changing devices. Amazon Cognito is used in web and mobile app development.. is a search & analysis service that helps you deploy, run, and secure Elasticsearch in a cost-effective way. With this AWS service, you can search, analyze, and store immense amounts of data in record time. You get all search responses quickly because Elasticsearch searches an index instead of scouting the text precisely. The service has built-in integrations with ., and other AWS services like Amazon Lambda, Amazon Cloudwatch, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Amazon Elasticsearch is mostly used for search, infrastructure and application monitoring, and security information & event management (SIEM)..Amazon Cloudwatch is a monitoring and log analytics service that gives you access to data and actionable insights for controlling your apps with just a 1-second granularity, improving resource utilization, and helps with reacting to system-wide performance changes. Cloudwatch is good for gathering and tracking metrics, it displays them about all AWS services you use automatically. This service is most often used with AWS services like AWS Lambda, S3, ElasticSearch, EC2, Fargate, tools and services like . and ., etc. .Amazon Fargate is a compute engine for containers that gets rid of the necessity of managing and provisioning servers, enhances security via app isolation by design, and allows you to define and pay for resources per application. This service divides the proper amount of compute resources so that you don’t have to scale cluster capacity or pick instances and can pay for resources per application. AWS Fargate works with both Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). .Amazon Step Functions is a function orchestrator that connects different AWS services with AWS Lambda Functions to develop complex multi-step workflows. Step Functions takes control of error handling, sequencing, retry logic, and state, making it easier for your team to handle the complexity of app management. Your app’s workflow will be shown through the graphical console as a string of event-driven steps so you can check the state of every step to confirm that the application runs smoothly. In case of failure of one component, dividing an application into steps (service components) with Step Functions will prevent the whole system from going down, plus you can update any component without redeploying the entire system after every adjustment. . is an agile content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers your content to users quickly and with low latency. Its progressive security capabilities offer protection against different attacks (like network and application layer DDoS attacks) by integrating with other AWS services such as AWS Web Application Firewall, AWS Shield, and Amazon Route 53.

        "You can not apply any more to this job offer. Please go to the list of all available jobs to find a still valid offer..Daltix is enabling retailers & suppliers to make decisions based on data rather than gut-feeling and for that it’s built up significant experience in how to collect data but also how to transform it in order to support decision making. To this end we’re looking for a downstream data engineer who’ll aid some of the biggest names in the industry (don’t take our word for it, .) in becoming truly data-driven..This position is ideal for an experienced python engineer who is looking to transition to working with data in a unique context. This sentence combined with the somewhat ambiguous title of \"Downstream\" Data Engineer certainly requires some explanation so let's go step by step in the style of a FAQ:.Answer: We have a set of core data collection and processing systems that are maintained by a few very specialized Data Engineers. These core systems make up the cutting-edge Data Lakes and Data Warehouses which are the lifeblood of the Daltix data pipeline. However, we don't deliver data directly to our clients from these core systems. On a regular basis, we ingest data from a few other sources (including the clients themselves), join this data with data from the core systems. This is why we call it \"Downstream\" - your work is mainly downstream from the core systems and thus does not require the same specialized work. This is what makes it a great place for a python engineer to transition into working with data. .\n .The second (and most important) reason that we consider this “Downstream” is that this is very much a client-facing role. In this role you will be experimenting with different methodologies and technologies that extract data from the core system and deliver value directly to clients in the form of reusable data marts, reports, visualizations, etc..Answer:. .with at least a few years of making your own design decisions. As the company has experienced significant growth and taken on several different clients in an ad-hoc way, there is (naturally) some technical debt to be paid down and this can only be done with an eye for careful design. If you've worked with designers or directly with business folks where it was required to translate requirements into code, your experience will be put to excellent use here..Besides this we expect you to be a. who can clearly communicate with our customer success managers as well as with the upstream, technical core of the company. Furthermore you’ll need . from our . data warehouse as well as basic . skills to transform & analyse data..Having worked with . would be a big plus but are not a strict requirement provided you're a fast learner..Answer: Daltix's systems are cutting edge, our stack is built on top of AWS and leverages Snowflake, one of the hottest cloud-based data warehouses right now. On top of that we’re currently setting up Looker, one of the most modern BI & dashboarding solutions right now..All of this is used to make some of the biggest retailers & retail suppliers data-driven, think Unilever, Makro, Lidl. You’ll be directly helping them in this transition..As you may not have significant experience in Data Engineering but are interested in taking the first step, there is no better way to do this than to use these systems. You'll work directly with Daltix's very small and elite team learning how all of this is done in a way that could lead naturally to a transition into working with these systems yourself..Answer: It is very rare for positions like this to arise and it will be a chance for you to make a huge difference in the company while at the same time taking a big step toward a career transition to being a Data Engineer. This startup is in a stage where product-market fit is starting to arise and a transition from super-agile and ad-hoc solutions must start to make way for more carefully designed and mature solutions. You can be the architect of this..\nYou'll also be working with very big retailers & retail suppliers and will learn how they look at data as well as the struggles they face in becoming data-driven. .On another level, you’ll have the opportunity to work with a set of seasoned professionals that have decades of experience in ., ., ., and .. Each area of the technical team is made up of members that have been there and done that in some of the hottest fields out there. This team combined with a bleeding edge stack build on AWS, Snowflake, Airflow, Looker and many others make this position one of potential, learning, and growth.",

Please port it to Javascript..\n.\n.\n .\n.\n.\n. .\nOur Python program to move the mammoth bones from the pits to the inside of the museum got sidetracked: the museum wants the procedure to be broadcasted worldwide via the internet and since Javascript is the language that all browsers handle natively, they have asked us to port the Python code to Javascript..No sweat… most likely we can do this in 10-15 minutes..\n.\n .\n.\n.Example: write a function that adds all the integers from a to b (with a <= b )\n.\n.\n .\n.\n.\n.Example: Fizzbuzz.Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”..\n .\n.\n.\n.We should be starting to realize the difference between knowing how to program and knowing a particular programming language. If our program uses only the fundamental structures, then we should be able to port it to a lot of languages with ease and it will look remarkably similar, just like the Python and JS versions of fizzbuzz above..For example, let’s port fizzbuzz to Php. Php is one of the most popular server-side languages. To port fizzbuzz, we do not need to master the language. Since we have been using mostly structures that are common to all the languages, all we need to do is to find how to write them in Php. Good places to search are the standards of the language, stackoverflow, and samples of code, e.g.,.\n .\n .\n.\n. .Let’s try Java, one of the most popular languages today.  Java’s syntax is more closer to that of Javascript and C than of Python. Let’s see a port of our fizzbuzz to Java and verify that we can easily understand the core concept; indeed, the Java version of fizzbuzz is almost identical to the Javascript version:.\n .\n .\n. . .Your homework is to port fizzbuzz to .. Lua is the scripting language of many games, e.g., “World of Warcraft”. Look at any website that has the syntax of Lua and get what you need to do your porting. Possible places to look at are:.Give it a good try before you look at the answer. Imagine the confidence that you will get in programming if you can port fizzbuzz to a language other than Python and Javascript .: Awesome!",

Vinarao\nPlease stop frightening folks with words like \"critical\". CSS is not a \"critical part of web pages\". CSS is styling, it's eye candy. It is perfectly possible to write a web page using HTML only and it will function. See...\nhttps://code.sololearn.com/WIFcuZ3XLQun/#html\nThe modern obsession with panels, animations and sliding images using CSS has become a triumph of form over content. With mobile phone users having the attention span of a guppy it's rare to see a paragraph of information per screen. One sentence being deemed sufficient.\nI'm beginning to think the movie \"Idiocracy\" was a prophecy not a comedy..+3.Go for CSS first as far as styling is concerned, there after go for JS for better display looking for the user (#decorations, animations, neon frameworks).+2.Learn in this order:\nHTML - CSS - Bootstrap CSS - js - jQuery\nThen you'll be an expert in front end development ;).+2.Css then JS.+1.Learn css then js .\nIf you have learned python then you can create web using python frameworks...\nBut having knowledge about them is necessary!.+1.i personally don't know css, but i know javascript. but it's better to know css because sometimes i get to struggle with design more than i struggle with functionality and it's time consuming..+1.James Clark I. Vinarao I think your answer is very misleading. jQuery and Dojo are libraries not frameworks. Also Angular and Bootstrap are not server-side frameworks..+1.I would recommend CSS first, and then JavaScript..+1.It depends what you want to do. Do you want to make text based programs? Learn javascript and use document.write(). Do you want to make cool looking, functional websites/webapps? You must have a solid understanding of html, then learn CSS, then javascript. I personally learned by slowly integrating JS into my websites, until I was super competent that I could code entirely in JS..0.Css and then Js.0.After HTML start with CSS to Javascript..0.I don't know if there is an order that people recommend learning these two in, but I say that it's better to start with CSS, as you'll find yourself using it more in your web pages. And I believe that CSS doesn't have as much to learn as javascript too, so it makes it a faster learning process. At the end of the day though, it comes down to what you would like to learn first -- if you're more interested in javascript, go for it!.0.You should learn css first then js..-1.I think first u have to learn Css then js.-1.css.Sololearn Inc..Send us a message",
