        "Python and Java are excellent and very popular programming languages. Despite their differences, they both stand out for their . as well as for their .. However, they do excel in different applications..Before choosing which programming language is better (if there is, in fact, a better one), it is first important to assess their key differences. Therefore, this article will compare both languages based on popularity, syntax, applications, stability, speed, performance, and easiness to learn!.Moreover, in order to fully understand how . and Java differ from each other, we will also present . from both..Python was first introduced in 1991. Guido van Rossum developed it at the National Research Institut for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands..This . was designed to fulfil general purposes and be highly readable. Dynamically typed means that Python executes type checking at runtime. Its easiness to use makes Python one of the most popular programming languages, thus being often compared with Perl, ., and of course, Java..Overall, Python is considered a very powerful and clear object-oriented programming language. It is ., including Windows, macOS, Unix, and Linux. Plus, Python is free software. Meaning, users can download and use Python for free, and the language can also be redistributed or modified freely since it is available under the ...Java was developed at Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle) by James Gosling and released in 1995. It is also a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that is statically typed (perform type checking at compile time). Java was intended to be ., which means: ...Java is compiled to bytecode, which can run on any .. Therefore, this language is . since it does not need to be compiled into a specific platform machine. Java's syntax presents similarities to C++ and C; however, it has fewer lower-level facilities.. - it can instantly convert human-readable code into machine-readable code.\n. - can be considered both since its source code is compiled into a binary bytecode, which in turn runs on the JVM (typically a software based interpreter).. -   Python is an Interpreted Language, dynamically typed.\n. - Java is a Compiled and Interpreted Language, which is statically typed.. - according to GitHub Octoverse, Stackoverflow, and Google Trends Python has a conquered slight popularity advantage over Java.. - up until recently, Java was ahead of Python in terms of popularity, but nowadays has less users than Python.. Scientific and numeric computing; Machine Learning applications; image processing; language development.  \n. Web applications; Desktop GUI Apps; enterprise solutions; embedded systems. . - the developer does not require to type in the variables since these are input during the runtime; does not need enclosing braces or indentiation rules.. -  the developer must type in all the variables and has very rigorous syntax rules..Compiles the code at runtime, thus being not as agile regarding compilation with every platform.\n.Java compiles code in advance and distributes the bytecode. Thanks to Java's static-typing syntax, the compilation is actually faster and easier than Python's dynamic-typing..Python tests the syntax during the runtime, thus not being as stable as Java despite the fast development.. - Since everything has to be reviewed and established before running, the code must be very well written and, therefore, the software might be more stable and less prone to crashes.. Fast development due to the easiness, simplicity and practicality to write in Python.  \n.Java projects tend to take longer and may require larger development teams. . - Suitable choice for beginners since its syntax is fairly easy and clear.. - There is a learning curve with a high entry point..Python and Java are two powerful competitors fighting for top positions regarding their popularity among programming languages. Truth be told, both languages stand out for their capabilities to handle most computer science tasks. Thus, deciding which one to go for might be tricky!.When it comes to popularity, . remains the most popular language for the eighth year in a row, according to .. However, Python (44.1%) and Java (40.2%) have a very close percentage of users..\n.\n.Similar results seem to occur regarding .. As we can observe, between 2018 and 2019, Java lost its slight advantage over Python. However, it does not mean that the battle between both languages is over since (to these days) Python has not yet been able to maintain a very significant lead..\n.\n.Once again, as the image below highlights, we can see that worldwide, we have witnessed an . throughout the last years. However, that increase is still very recent considering that up until 2015, Java had a clear advantage..\n.\n.Both Python and Java can often be used for Machine Learning and API interactions. However, while on the one hand, .; on the other hand, ...Java is a very recognized and used language for web development, being more well-known among senior developers. In addition to handling asynchronous programming, Java is also a very good option for Desktop GUI applications, Enterprise Solutions, Embedded Systems, and web application services. Plus, it has a useful and helpful . community..Contrarily, Python is very known for its outstanding data processing libraries (e.g., . and .), as well as data visualization (e.g., .) tools. Thus, it is often used by those interested in entering . and also by junior developers. Overall, Python provides ., such as . and ., which are both written in this language..In fact, when it comes to ., Python has often been considered a more suitable option since it is syntactically straightforward and offers a vast library package and resources. However, for some, Java is also a compelling option regarding Machine Learning due to its easy debugging and ability to handle large-scale operations and enterprise programs. Plus, developers can also work with Weka, Deeplearning4j and other libraries using Java..Python is an interpreted language, meaning it can instantly convert human-readable code into machine-readable code, making it easier to debug and review..Java is a compiled language. Compiled languages translate source code into machine code before running it..As previously mentioned, Python is a ., and Java is statically typed. This is the most significant difference between these object-oriented languages since it impacts how the developer writes, designs, and troubleshoots programs..While typing code, the developer does not require inputting the variables since these are input during the runtime, making Python a very easy and straightforward language. This makes Python also very .. Another great plus is that this language does not need enclosing braces, and the code blocks are organized according to indentation, making ...Contrarily, Java requires the . to type in all the variables and has very rigorous syntax rules. Whenever there is an error in the code, the program will not run, which can be very frustrating and demotivating, especially for beginners. For instance, while Java takes ten lines of code to read from a file; Python, on the other hand, only requires two lines of code..Unlike Python (which allows for indentation for writing blocks with multiple lines), Java needs to insert the lines inside of curly brackets to establish and define a method or a block..Take a look at the following examples comparing Python with Java regarding similar functions:.Python and Java are . since they both compile bytecode and run it in virtual machines. However, Java compiles code in advance and distributes the bytecode, while Python tends to compile the code at runtime..Thanks to Java's static-typing syntax, the compilation is actually faster and easier than Python's dynamic typing. Despite the previously mentioned disadvantages, the . and is more strict regarding the targeted platform, consequently improving code compilation..Furthermore, Java also provides a .. This device enables the bytecode to be compiled into the native machine, which allows the compiled code to be called directly. The result? A faster performance..Python processes code during the compile-time (which is when variables are considered). When the code follows a dynamic-typed syntax, it is not as agile regarding compilation with every platform. Further, as stated, ., meaning that it can keep the whole application on hold if any error occurs with the program. Consequently, both of these factors can lead to reduced language speed and efficiency..Unlike Python, Java requires the developer to write according to . and include all the variables. In consequence, there is more code volume, more code to review, and more code to fix. But there is a good side to this! Since everything has to be reviewed and established before running, the code must be very well written and, therefore, the software might be more stable and less prone to crashes..This is why Java is usually considered the . such as banks. In fact, Java is often very associated with traditional language for corporations. Nonetheless, Python has also proven to have no trouble handling large-scale software..To say that Java offers great software stability does not mean that Python is unstable. In comparison, indeed, big companies, such as Android, Docker, and Airbnb, include Java in their tech stack. On the other hand, it is also true that Reddit and even Instagram (Django web framework written in Python) use Python . as part of their tech stack..In Python, the development is incredibly fast due to the easiness, simplicity and practicality to write in this language. When working against the clock, Python is most likely the best solution. However, we cannot say the same about Java regarding development speed. Java projects tend to take longer and may require larger development teams..In fact, building an . in Python can be surprisingly fast (in a matter of weeks), while in Java, months would most likely be the case..There is a consensus that . since its syntax is fairly easy and clear. Plus, Python is a more user-friendly and intuitive language..Java, in turn, is more complex and challenging. There is a . regarding this language since it takes a lot of time to fully understand how to write in Java and how each API may differ..It is also argued that .; however, it is also important to keep in mind that an experienced Python developer can benefit from the same functionalities as in Java..Ideally, an outstanding developer would benefit greatly from learning both languages. As we have previously observed, Python and Java excel at different applications. To begin coding, Python might be easier to learn, but Java is far from being impossible; it just takes longer..Although Python is expected to run slower than Java, it also takes less time to develop. Due to the ., as well as dynamic typing, Python is usually shorter than equivalent Java programs, thus being more straightforward and faster to develop..Since Java requires more code and everything needs to be pre-defined, developers also need more time to review everything and fix potential errors. Naturally, the more code there is, the more complex it gets. Nonetheless, the rigour it takes to write the code well can also result in a more ...Simply put, .. Contrarily, .. Ultimately, the better programming language is the one that meets the type of software program the developer wishes to create. Ideally, as referred, developers would benefit from learning both languages..After carefully analyzing the programming languages, it is no surprise that both .. Python stands out for its simplicity and practicality, making development less complex. On the other hand, Java is not as simple to use, but it does offer outstanding stability and is a great way for the developer to apply computer science fundamentals..Plus, as we have observed, Python programs are typically shorter than the equivalent programs in Java due to Python's dynamic typing as well as the built-in high-level data types. However, Java is faster at runtime and also easier to debug..In short, both languages provide so many advantages that together they would make an outstanding combination!.\n.\n.At ., we simplify complex systems, delivering interfaces that users love.\n          If you’ve enjoyed this article, you will certainly enjoy our newsletter, which may be subscribed below.\n          Take this chance to also check our .\n          and, if there is any project that you think we can help with, feel free to ..

        "Should you choose . or . for your next project? Are you fortunate enough to have a choice? Are one of these languages a better option?.According to GitHub’s annual Octoverse report, Java and Python are the second and third most popular languages for the fourth year in a row. According to the same story, Python is one of the top ten fastest growing languages. Most of the other fast-gainers are new languages, while Python has been around longer than Java..At the time of writing, the . places Java at the top of their list and Python at number three.. places Python at number two on their list of languages for open source projects. Java is in fourth place, with only half the adoption of Python..So, the two languages are popular and aren’t going anywhere. Which one is your best choice?.Java was originally created by Oracle in 1995, and is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. One of the main focuses when designing Java was to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It’s a general purpose language, used frequently for desktop computing, mobile computing, games, and numerical computing..Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. It was deigned with a philosophy of making code easier to read than alternative languages, with a use of significant indentation. It is commonly used for data analytics and machine learning, but has a wide range of uses..Java and Python have many similarities. Both languages have strong cross-platform support and extensive standard libraries. They both treat (nearly) everything as objects. Both languages compile to bytecode, but Python is (usually) compiled at runtime. They are both members of the Algol family, although Python deviates further from C/C++ than Java does..Support for Python 2.x will end on January 1, 2020. For a long time, Python development has fragmented between version 2.7 and the regular releases of new 3.x versions. But, with the end-of-life date for Python 2 a year away, the question over which version to use is settled. The community has centered on Python 3..Meanwhile, . created a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the software community. Even though the announcement provided a free (as in beer) option and a clear upgrade path, .. Several platforms providers, such as Red Hat and Amazon, have stepped in to support OpenJDK. But the once unified Java community is more fragmented than Python ever was.\nLet’s take a closer look at the similarities and differences between Java vs. Python..Python and Java are both object-oriented languages, but Java uses static types, while Python is dynamic. This is the most significant difference and affects how you design, write, and troubleshoot programs in a fundamental way. Let’s look at two code examples..First, in Python, we’ll create an array with some data in it, and print it to the console..Next, let’s try it in Java..In Python, we put two strings and an integer in the same array, and then printed the contents. For Java, we declared a List of Strings and put three string values in it..We can’t mix types in a Java array. The code won’t compile..We could declare the array as containing Object instead of String, and override Java’s type system. But, that’s not how any experienced Java developer uses the language..In Python, we don’t have to provide a type when we declare the array and can put whatever we want in it. It’s up to us to make sure we don’t try to misuse the contents..For example, what if we modified the code above to do this?.The above code will throw an error when we try to run it since we can’t append an integer with a string. What are advantages and disadvantages to dynamic typing and static typing?.Static typing catches type errors at compile time. So, if mixing strings and integers weren’t what you wanted to do, the Java compiler catches the mistake. How much of an advantage compile-time checks is up for debate in .. But, static typing does enforce a discipline that some developers appreciate..Whether static typing prevents errors or not, it does make code run faster. A compiler working on statically-typed code can optimize better for the target platform. Also, you avoid runtime type errors, adding another performance boost..Code that’s written with dynamic types tends to be less verbose than static languages. Variables aren’t declared with types, and the type can change. This saves a copy or type conversion to new variable declarations..The question of code readability comes up often when debating Java vs. Python. Let’s take a look at that next..Let’s take an example from Java and Python and compare them. In this example, we need to open a large text file and collect each line into sets of 50 comma-separated records.\nHere is the Python code:.Here’s the Java code:.Whitespace is part of Python’s syntax, while Java ignores it. Python uses tabs for nesting and a full colon to start loops and conditional blocks. Java ignores whitespace and uses semicolons, parentheses and curly braces.\nArguments over which code is easier to read, like the debate over static vs. dynamic typing, are subjective. Some say Python code is more concise and uniform than Java because your formatting choices are more limited. Python’s use of whitespace ends debates over how to format code. The only option you have left is how to use blank lines..The Python snippet is a few lines shorter than the Java snippet, a difference that adds up in larger programs. Much of the difference is because there are no closing braces. But Python’s brevity—when compared to Java —goes deeper..Let’s look at how the two languages handle files..Here’s Python again:.Here’s Java:.In both cases, the declaration creates a block. The file resource remains in scope, and the languages close it when the code exits the block..In Python, we’re opening a file and reading from it. When the loop reaches the end of the file, the loop exits..Java is more complicated. We’re opening a BufferedReader by passing it a FileReader. We consume lines from the reader. It’s our responsibility to check for null when the file ends..This only demonstrates that it’s easier to handle text files in Python. But, it demonstrates how Java tends to be more verbose than Python. “Pythonic” constructs are more concise and less demanding. Java has evolved over the past few releases, with the introduction of try-with-resources in Java 7 and lambdas in Java 8, but it’s still a verbose language..Let’s revisit our first example..Here’s the Python again:.Here is the Java:.Both of these snippets will build and run as is. Python will run a script from beginning to end of a file. Java requires at least one entry point, a static method named main. The JVM (Java virtual machine) runs this method in the class passed to it on the command line..Putting together a Python program tends to be faster and easier than in Java. This is especially true of utility programs for manipulating files or retrieving data from web resources..Both Java and Python compile to bytecode and run in virtual machines. This isolates code from differences between operating systems, making the languages cross-platform. But there’s a critical difference. Python usually compiles code at runtime, while Java compiles it in advance, and distributes the bytecode..Most JVMs perform just-in-time compilation to all or part of programs to native code, which significantly improves performance. Mainstream Python doesn’t do this, but a few variants such as . do..The difference in performance between Java and Python is . in some cases. A simple binary tree test runs ten times faster in Java than in Python..So, which language is your best choice?.Oracle’s new support model changes the Java landscape. While there is still a free option, the new release schedule and support model gives developers a reason to take stock. Java clients will need to pay Oracle for support, change OpenJDK versions on a regular basis, or rely on third parties like Red Hat or Amazon for fixes and security updates..At the same time, Python has cleared a significant hurdle with Python 3. Python has a more unified support model than Java for the first time, and open source developers are focusing their efforts on the latest version of the language. I have to give Python the edge here..Whether Python’s dynamic typing is better than Java’s static approach is subjective. The debate between the two models predates both of them, and it’s a question of what’s best for you and your team..After working on large projects in both languages, I feel secure saying that Python’s syntax is more concise than Java’s. It’s easier to get up and running quickly with a new project in Python than it is in Java. Python wins again..Performance is where Java has a substantial advantage over Python. Java’s just-in-time compilation gives it an advantage over Python’s interpreted performance. While neither language is suitable for latency-sensitive applications, Java is still a great deal faster than Python..All things considered, Python’s advantages outweigh the disadvantages. If you’re not already considering it, give it another look..In any project, whether you choose Python or Java make sure it’s error free with Raygun. Raygun automatically detects errors and performance problems with sophisticated .. Get started today and ..",
        "While we all started to learn how to code with HTML, developing a sophisticated app requires a more advanced language. Java and Python are two of the hottest programming languages in the market right now because of their versatility, efficiency, and automation capabilities. Both languages have their merits and their flaws, but the main difference is that . is statically typed and Python is dynamically typed..They have similarities, as they both adopt the “everything is an object” design, have great cross-platform support, and use immutable strings and deep standard libraries. However, they have plenty of differences that steer some coders towards Java and others towards Python. . has always had a single large corporate sponsor, while Python is more distributed..Here’s how the two languages are different and how to decide which one better fits your goals..The phrase “dynamically typed” . performs type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages like Java perform type checking at compile time. Python can compile even if they contain errors that would prevent the script from running properly. On the other hand, when ., it will not compile until the errors have been fixed..Java also requires you to declare the data types of your variables before using them, while Python does not. Because it is statically typed, it expects its variables to be declared before they can be assigned values. Python is more flexible and can save you time and space when running scripts. However, it can cause you issues at runtime..Choosing a language boils down to what you’re trying to achieve with your code. Performance is not of the essence in software at all times, but it is always worth keeping in mind. Java is more efficient when it comes to performance speed thanks to its optimizations and virtual machine execution..You can add Python implementations without this restriction, but they can negatively affect portability assumptions within the Python code. Therefore, when it comes to sheer speed performance, ...However, Python is more effective when it comes to adapting legacy systems. The language is more suited to make changes to an existing legacy system. Python can make gradual shifts instead of fully rewriting and revamping the system like Java does..Java in the enterprise world is a more verbose coding style, which means that these systems are often larger and more numerous than Python legacy. The latter language is more common among enterprise code that glues their IT infrastructure together, making it more effective in adapting legacy systems..As far as practical agility goes, both languages have their pros and cons. Recent advancements in DevOps have benefited both as Java thrives on more consistent refactoring support. This is due to the language’s static type system, which makes automated refactored more predictable and reliable..Meanwhile, Python’s dynamic system relies on brevity, fluidity, and experimentation in code, giving it more versatility than Java’s rigid style. Python has also been adapting to automated testing in modern development, but this happens more frequently in integration instead of unit testing..Choosing which language to goes with depends on your company’s needs, and which setbacks you’re willing to accept. While Java churns out higher performance speed, Python is more suited to evolve legacy systems. When it comes to practical agility, Java is a more proven option, while Python has more flexibility for experimentation..Java is still king in the coding space as it remains the most popular language. It has traditionally been the language to teach beginners, but this is quickly changing as Python is .. A recent survey from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) found that Python has surpassed Java as the most popular language to introduce students to programming..The survey found that eight of the top 10 computer science departments in the U.S. now use Python to teach coding, as well as 27 of the top 39 schools. Python’s becoming more popular in the academic world for only three or four years as it is being taught as early as high school and through college..There are several reasons for this shift, including that Python is a general-purpose language, which means that it can be used to build almost anything. The language is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence and scientific computing. In addition to its professional uses, it can also be used to create games, productivity tools, and desktop apps..Since its inception, Python was created so it would be easy to understand and easy to use as the name came from Monty Python. It is more beginner-friendly because it reads like English, making it a more intuitive learning experience from a syntactical standpoint. The language takes a load off coders by taking care of a lot of the language’s complexity..Plus, Python is very flexible because it is dynamically typed. While Java has hard rules on how to build features, Python offers different methods to solve the same problem. The language is also more forgiving of errors, allowing you to compile and run your program easily..One major downside for beginners is that Python can be difficult to maintain as errors are hard to track down and fix. The rigid nature of Java ensures that you fix every problem in real time, saving you time fixing code later down the line. Python is also slower because of how flexible it is, slowing its performance down, making Java more attractive in that sense..While Java certainly has its benefits and it can do wonders for experienced coders, Python makes the most sense for beginners. It is more flexible, has a more intuitive user interface and it creates a more enjoyable coding experience..Both languages have . and they’re both open source. This means that coders are constantly fixing bugs with the languages and updating them, making both viable coding options for the future. As things stand, Java is the most popular programming language in the world, while Python is top-five..Java programmers have Java User Groups (JUGs), which are some of the most popular coding communities in the world. They also have JavaOne, a high-profile programming event that shows no signs of slowing down. Meanwhile, Python has 1,637 user groups in 191 cities and 37 countries with more than 860,000 members. The language has events as well, including PyCon and PyLadies for women to meet and code together..Learning either language will help you get a job in computer science, but predicting which trend will go further in the future is hard to do. There will always be coders with different preferences, with Java attracting those who prefer a more straightforward language. Coders who wish to have more flexibility coding, such as data scientists on a machine learning project, will prefer Python..There are different jobs for each of these languages, but it’s worth noting that Python may be making more strides than Java at the moment. Python tools such as GREENLETS and GEVENT allow asynchronous IO capabilities with a threading-like programming style. This means that the language can be written in twisted code without hurting the brains of its users by relying on stack-switching assembly code for greenlets..There’s also Kivy, a Python tool that makes it easier to write mobile applications. The language moves away from traditional web technologies, making it an exciting option for the future. With the language, you could talk to telco gear through a custom C extension. Python’s recent update fixes error messages, the ability to modify PATH in the Windows installer, and other features to make things easier for coders..Python has the slight edge over Java as far as the future goes, but neither language is perfect and Java adopters will continue to try to perfect the language moving forward..We can’t tell you which language to choose, but rest assured that both languages will be relevant for years to come. Python is a good choice for beginners as the language is more intuitive and its syntax is similar to the English language. It’s also in the midst of a revolution as its open source nature is paving the way for a slew of new tools to improve it..Java has plenty to offer as open source as well as it deals with performance issues more resolutely. Choosing a language ultimately comes down to preference as Java is geared more towards perfectionists looking to build clear, consistent code using complex syntax. Some will prefer this system, while others prefer to have the flexibility, brevity and fluidity of Python..With support for both Python and Java, improve your application performance with Stackify Retrace.  .7171 Warner Ave.Suite B787.Huntington Beach, CA 92647.PO Box 2159.Mission, KS 66201.Stay up to date with the latest in software development with Stackify’s . newsletter.",

        "Forget about the programming for a moment and let’s talk about the car…. Some people like Tesla, some are comfortable with Lamborghini for some people none of them is useful (.) for others, it’s not fair to compare both of them. Now come to the programming languages..If you are one of them who is completely taking the favor of one language and looking out for the right answer then you will be disappointed while reading this blog..Computer languages are sometimes taken (oftentimes by novice users) as a religion – so one may swear by Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, or some other language. The reality is that out of the major programming languages, each seemed to have found a “sweet spot” – an area or domain where it shines, compared with others. So instead of fighting over the question that . we will help you in figure out .A lot of programmers are confused about making the decision whose impact is going to be long-lasting and is going to shape their career in many ways. What if they choose java and later Python goes up or what if they choose Python and later java becomes more popular. Now to clear off the initial air of confusion let’s start with some surveys….We know that after checking the surveys you are still confused about making the decision so we are going to take one more step considering some factors that may help you in making a decision. First of all, remember that all the languages are essentially the same, and all languages can more or less do the same thing in some way or the other. If Python has some advantages then it also has some disadvantages and the same goes for Java. Let’s see some factors and key differences for both of the languages….Firstly let’s take a look at Java syntax to add two numbers….Now let’s see how to write the same code in Python….Python is a dynamically typed programming language which means there is no necessity of declaring variables whereas java is a statically typed programming language which means you need to declare the variables explicitly. From the above code, you can see that Python syntax is fairly easy to learn so good for novice programmers but we need to mention that Python hides many internal details from programmers compared to Java. For example, in the above code of Python, it’s not mentioned that variables first and second are integers so you won’t be able to know what’s going under the hood..Well, if you aren’t a computer science student, or are not interested in computer science fundamentals but need a programming language to get something done then go for Python. Another side if you are one of them who cares about the core CS concepts (or computer science students) then go for Java. In the end, all we can say is .In development employers really care about the performance or speed of the application. Java comes with Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and so it is a compiled language and takes lesser time for code execution. On the other hand, Python is an interpreted language and determines the type of data at run time which makes it slower comparatively. Therefore, for the development of heavy applications, preference, of course, is given to Java. Here we also need to mention that developers can speed up the execution of Python code with the use of PyPy, CPython or Cython. They can use Jython to compile the Python code into Java bytecode, and Cython to compile the Python code into C/C++ code..In development, it’s really important to have huge community support for a language. You can build some tools and allow others to use that. You can also get the solution or advice for coding related problems or issues from the programmer’s community. Java and Python both enjoy great community support. You will encounter tons of resources, forums, and books to help with your learning for both of the languages. You can also get huge support from GitHub and StackOverflow..Java is a product of Oracle and so its convention Oracle Code One, JavaWorld, and JavaRanch have contributed to its widespread popularity in software development. There are several . across the globe. Also, various high-profile events like JavaOne organized by Java programmers..Python has a strong community of over . in around 37 countries and 191 cities. .s, the ., ., and the . channels have contributed to its popularity and diversity of programmers. Check out their community support from the link ...You might have heard that .. This language is used for both . and .. Most of the complex programs are usually written in Java and that is the reason it is good to build large scale applications. Java is good for Desktop apps, Embedded applications, Data processing apps, Mobile, and web apps and Enterprise-level solutions. A wide range of libraries and frameworks are also available to add new functionality to your app or program..Python is especially popular among .and .. It is widely used in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and the general overarching AI field. This language is very useful in data analysis and visualization. Python is also used in web development or backend development using some popular frameworks such as Django, Tornado, Flask or CherryPy to use in web apps. Python is also used in IoT, games, prototypes, graphic design apps and it is often used by system administrators to automate tasks. Python libraries are very useful in research and computation. Mobile development in Python is less popular..A lot of big companies are using Java for their large application or enterprise-level solutions. Java is also widely used in Android application so it’s high in demand in the job market. Top companies like Uber, Airbnb, Twitter, Amazon, eBay, Linkedin, and many others use Java in their tech stack. This means that finding a job as a Java developer is relatively easy. Take a look at StackOverflow for Java developer’s jobs..Average salary of Java Developer on . is . in India..Instagram front-end for iOS is written in Objective-C, and the back-end is written in Python. Some other big companies like Google, Spotify, Netflix, Uber, Dropbox, Reddit, and Pinterest using Python in their tech stack however we need to mention that Python is not used heavily in big companies for enterprise software development..Python is widely used by a lot of startups for building web applications and it is also popular among data scientists. You have plenty of job opportunities to enter in various application areas of Python..Take a look at StackOverflow for Python developer’s jobs..Average salary of Python Developer on . is . in India..Python has surpassed Java as the top language used to introduce U.S. students to programming and computer science, according to a recent survey posted by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Eight of the top 10 computer science departments now use Python to teach coding, as well as 27 of the top 39 schools, indicating that it is the most popular language for teaching introductory computer science courses. Java is frequently used in high school advanced courses, so the transition to Java in college is a natural one for students. A number of universities, however, have switched to Python from Java, and others offer both — Java for computer science students and Python to teach programming skills for noncomputer science majors..We have discussed all the stats and we have also discussed the major factors still if you are confused and asking yourself…. then you need to ask one more question to yourself…. or . Yes…don’t learn a language just for the sake of its popularity or some programmers have suggested to you. Understand that there is no best programming language. Every language fits in a specific area, every language has it’s own pros and cons and the same goes for Python and Java as well..First of all, decide .. Do you want to build a mobile application or a web application? Do you want to enter data science or machine learning or you have some plans to enter in game development?. How scalable your application would be? what speed do you expect from your application? what’s the budget of the company? and a lot of factors like that you need to consider. Choosing a language isn’t about it being easy or hard, it’s about how you see coding as a whole.

        "In computer science, programming languages are a fundamental part and are very crucial in developing various applications. In recent days, Python and Java have emerged as two of the most widely used programming languages Both of them are popular languages with a great array of libraries and it is often difficult to choose one among them. Java has been there since long and hence more popular compared to Python, but Python is gaining its popularity, nowadays, because of its simplicity..Are you unable to decide which language is better - Python or Java? Reading this Python Vs Java article will definitely give you a clear vision of what is best. Here, we will discuss the comparison of programming languages Python and Java..So, let us begin with the Java definition first, which I am going to talk about in the section below..Java is a high-level, object-oriented, secure and robust programming language that also serves as a platform. A platform is a software or hardware environment on which a program runs. Java has its own runtime environment called JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and API (Application Program Interface), hence it is also a platform. It is highly portable, can run on various platforms such as MAC OS, Windows and various versions of UNIX.  It was developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995..Python is a high-level, general-purpose, interactive and interpreted programming language, developed by Guido Van Rossum, in 1989. It is open source and its source code can be found under GNU General Public License (GPL) so that anyone can modify the source code. It has easy-to-use syntax, which makes it perfect for the beginners. Python has interfaces to various libraries and operating system calls and can be extended to C and C++..Java is not as trendy as it used to be in the past, but, still, it is one of the most popular languages in use. On the other hand, Python is new and still evolving, and it is gaining popularity among the developers because of its elegant coding style. It is said that Python will probably overtake the popularity of Java in the future. The reasons for this fast growth of python are productivity, libraries, ease of learning and language flexibility. .Java still hasn’t lost the race. The developers keep adding new features to make it more powerful, faster and flexible. After all, it has the mighty . which makes cross-platform application development easier. .Let's see some of the major differences between Python and Java:.Python is a dynamically typed language. In Python there is no need to declare any variable and it is assumed by the interpreter during runtime. Variables can be changed as per the developer’s wish, for example, string variable can be used as integer. Dynamic typing makes the code highly readable, easy and precise and at the same time difficult to analyse. The drawback of dynamically typed language is that the type is decided while runtime so it makes the process slow..Java is a static language, where one can’t change the type of the variable, though integer variables can be type casted to floating point as it has shallow range. Variables must be declared with their data type before using them. As the variables are already defined during the compiled time, it is easier and much faster than Python..Python has unusual formatting among the programming languages. It uses indentations to separate the code blocks. Programmers easily choose Python as it offers simplicity and great code readability. In Python, programs can be written in few lines which would be complex in other languages..Java is not definitely the easiest language for beginners. The code blocks in Java are separated by curly braces. The programmers need to spend extra time and effort to make the code readable and it always involves many lines of code even for simple logic. .Python is interpreted language. So, the variables are not declared while writing the program. The types of the variable are assumed during run time by the interpreter, which uses extra processing time and memory. It increases the workload of the interpreter in runtime which makes it slow..On the other hand, Java has the just-in-time compiler that runs as a part of Java Virtual Machine. The compiler compiles the byte code generated into native code and the JVM calls this native code directly. As there is no interpretation, it doesn’t take much of processor time and memory. .Syntactically Python is way simpler than Java. For ending an executive statement, in Python there is no Semicolon. .For a single line comment, ‘#’ is used and for multi-line comment ””” (three inverted commas) .Indentation is mandatory in Python for blocks with multiple lines. .Semicolon is compulsory in java to end an executive statement. .For a single line comment, ‘//’ is used and for multi-line comment ‘/* */ is used. .The code blocks are separated by curly braces in Java programming..Both the programming languages are highly portable, but, because of JVM, Java has a little edge over Python. Python runs everywhere, it is a matter of changing paths and settings in the respective operating systems (MAC, WINDOWS, LINUX). To run Python program, there should be a compiler in place to convert the Python code into a code that the particular operating system understands. .Java doesn’t need any compiler to convert the code to understandable code to the operating system, all it needs is a Java Virtual Machine. Thanks to the development of technology, in almost all the mobile or computer devices JVM comes pre-installed. So, the developer can be sure that their application will be used by almost all the users..Python and Java both are termed as secure languages, yet Java is more secure than Python. Java has advanced authentication and access control functionalities which keep the web application secure. As Java has bytecode, every time when the compiler compiles the code, a class file is created along with the bytecode which is tested by the JVM for malwares and viruses.  .Python is a simple and easy-to-debug language. With minimum code, it is easier to debug and prevent future risks of code getting complicated. Python also has advanced security measures, but, when compared to Java, it falls short..Mobile application development is the process of developing application software for handheld devices such as mobile phones, tablets, etc. When it comes to the selection of language to develop mobile applications, it depends on the platform. Java happens to perform very well in android applications. The Android SDK includes many standard Java libraries along with their own to develop good mobile applications. .Mobile development’s priority is speed. As Python is an interpreted language and consumes more memory and processing speed at the runtime, it is not preferred by most of the developers, when it comes to mobile app development. Python doesn’t have the option for building any native applications for mobile devices, yet it can be created as cross-platform applications using libraries like Kivy. Mobile applications need a framework that is fast and has smooth functionality for which Java is more suited..In the following section, we will learn about the difference in programming between these two languages with an example - EMI Calculator in Python and Java. The program is for the calculation of monthly EMI, where the principal amount, rate of interest and time period are passed to a function. The function calculates the emi with the input passed and returns to the function call in main function..Python and Java are used across various fields along with many technologies and frameworks. In this section, we will discuss about the uses and application of both the languages in various fields..Python, because of its simplicity, is chosen by many experts and data scientists for developing machine learning algorithms. Python is widely used in machine learning, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data because of its rich libraries and packages. Commonly used packages for machine learning in Python are tensor flow, scikit-learn and Pytorch. .Nowadays, programmers also use Java for machine learning but not as much as Python. After all, there is no Hadoop without Java Virtual Machine. However, it is good to use Java in machine learning when it is a project related to cybersecurity, fraud detection and network security. Commonly used Java packages for machine learning are WEKA, Mallet and MOA. . .Java is the most preferred language for developing games because of its high performing frameworks. Game development required highest possible performance to offer seamless user experience, for which Python is not suitable. There are many gaming environments that uses Python but only as a scripting language. There are many powerful game developing engines such as JMonkey that helps in creating great games..Python and Java are used mostly in Backend web development. Backend web development is concerned with developing set of software that runs on servers. Both the languages have powerful frameworks for web development. As Python is very easy syntactically, programmers prefer Python for productive web development. However, Java’s static typing makes sure there would be no mistakes in the code lines. Flash and Django are two widely used frameworks in Python for web development. Java has Spring framework for web development..Although both Java and Python are popular languages, the recent trends show that there is more demand for Python developers in the corporates than the Java engineers. Many of the experienced Java developers find it difficult to shift from Java to Python. As Python is a new language and still evolving there is only a handful who are experts in Python, so, less supply and more demand have led to more pay..The fresh Python developers get more than the fresh Java developers, whereas, the experienced Java developers get more than the experienced Python developers.  .Both the languages have bright future as both of them have advanced libraries and frameworks that can cope up with the modern technologies. It all depends on the applications that are under development. When it comes to developing infrastructure software (Operating systems etc), cross-platform software, security then Java would be preferred. On the other hand, when it comes to developing new algorithms for Data Science, analytics, machine learning, developers would prefer Python. Both the languages are still evolving and getting better day by day..Both the programming languages have their own advantages and disadvantages such as, python is easy to code, simpler to learn with huge library, high level of code readability and Java is more compatible and best in developing mobile applications and games. Both of them are widely accepted and capable programming languages that can adapt themselves along with new technologies. For people who are new to programming, it is better to choose python, as it is easy to learn and has English-like syntax whereas, if the aim is to build an enterprise level applications then it’s Java any day. .If you are interested to learn Python and to become an Python Expert?

        "Machine learning, Data Science, deep learning, and many other major and rising disruptive technologies need one or two programming languages to create products and services for the global tech market. Companies and start-ups have started recruiting employees who are from a technical background with sufficient knowledge of anyone or two programming languages such as Python, Java, R, C++, etc. for efficient coding. Strong coding skills are essential to deal with cutting-edge technologies. Aspiring machine learning engineers, machine learning architects, data scientists, and so on are highly interested to learn Python and Java as these two have the highest demand in this field. This article is a machine learning guide for beginners to explain the differences between Python and Java for a better understanding.. .Python is a high-level and one of the top programming languages in recent times for efficient coding. It is also known for its object-oriented and structured programming that is fully supported on any server to create web applications. Developers can build robust applications with the help of Python due to its English-like syntax. This feature helps them to read and understand the code easily, without much trouble. There are many employees who do not have a technical background and are just beginners but have to learn Python for professional careers— Python is very easy to pick up and learn in a short span of time. There is a need for fewer lines of code to perform than C++ or Java..Python is popular in the community owing to its productive nature because it helps developers to focus more on solving complex real-life problems and less on the syntax of the coding language.  It directly executes the code line by line and detects potential errors before the final execution. The interpreted language automatically assigns certain types of real-time data during the execution. The most important characteristic of Python is that it is free to use and anyone can download the source code, modify, and distribute their own version of Python without having any prior training..There is also a vast array of machine learning libraries for Python where developers can find multiple functions for different tasks without depending on any external library.. .Java is also a high-level, multi-platform, network-centric, and object-oriented programming language to have a few implementation dependencies from developers. It is used for internet-based applications as a simple and efficient coding language. Java is also an extremely portable and interpreted language like Python. The same applications will run identically on different hardware and operating systems without any hindrance. The source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code that runs on Java virtual machine..Java is known as a dynamic programming language that is also easy to learn for beginners and can be written, compiled, debugged, and learned faster. Developers can create modular programs and reusable code.. .Recently, there is a bridge between the use of Python and Java due to a higher demand for Python in the tech-driven world..That being said, it has been observed that the demand for Python is thriving in the global tech market and tech-savvy developers prefer to use this programming language over other ones. Python holds a promising future ahead while creating demand in multiple companies and start-ups. But, it is essential to learn both Python and Java after learning about the differences for a successful career path in the tech-driven future.. . .\n.\n",
        "This tutorial is for Processing's Python Mode.\n        If you see any errors or have comments, please .. This work is licensed under a . .Processing.py is based on the Java implementation of .. It makes use of\n    ., an implementation of Python\n    that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), to directly access the\n    underlying Java library. The benefit of this strategy is that your\n    Processing.py sketches can do pretty much anything regular Processing\n    sketches can do, and newer versions of Processing.py immediately benefit\n    from performance enhancements and new features that are added to the Java\n    implementation. When you're making sketches with Processing.py, you have\n    access to best of three different software platforms and ecosystems:\n    Python, Java, and Processing..However, if you're already familar with any of these platforms, you may\n    find that some things work in unintuitive way, or fail to work at all. This\n    tutorial is designed to help you become literate about how Processing.py,\n    Processing, Python and Java all work together, so you can reason better\n    about how to diagnose problems and use the full potential of the\n    platform..Jython is an implementation of Python that runs on the Java Virtual\n    Machine (JVM). Jython was initially developed as a way to write Python\n    programs that make use of existing Java libraries, frameworks and\n    infrastructure. Jython is designed to be as compatible as possible\n    with all Python programs, and is generally just as fast as . (the\n    \"reference\" implementation of Python, written in C) for most tasks..However, Jython does have some significant limitations, especially if\n    you're used to working with CPython. For more details, see the .. But here's a rundown of the most important differences for\n    users of Processing.py..The latest version of Jython implements Python 2.7. Python 2.7 is still\n    widely used, but Python 3 (which has a number of incompatibilities with\n    earlier versions) is gaining popularity. If you're new to Python, keep in\n    mind that some tutorials and example programs you find on the web will be\n    written in Python 3, not Python 2.7, and may require a bit of reworking to\n    make them functional in Processing.py..Jython supports almost all of the Python standard\n    library (i.e., the libraries that come with Python when you first install\n    it). One notable exception is .\n    (although you can access SQLite databases using ODBC, and .. Jython does\n    *not* support third-party Python libraries that use extensions written in\n    C. This means that popular Python libraries like ., . and . . in Jython (and, for this reason, will not work in\n    Processing.py)..Unfortunately, there's no easy way to tell whether or not a\n    library uses a C extension (or has a dependency on a library with a C\n    extension) without attempting to install it, though there\n    are some libraries that ship with a pure-Python fallback if it's impossible\n    to compile the C extension..Java is a statically-typed language, whereas Python is dynamically\n    typed. To make the two languages talk to each other, the implementors of\n    Jython had to bridge the gap. This can occasionally result in unexpected\n    problems when attempting to call Java code from Jython, or when attempting\n    to write Jython code that can be called into from Java code..One notable example is that classes in Jython are defined at\n    . (unlike pure Java classes, which are usually defined at\n    compile-time). This means that a number of features that are important for\n    interoperability with Processing libraries, like method introspection, .. The . from . has a number of good tips and tricks..One of the goals of Processing.py is to follow the standard Processing\n    API as closely as possible. This means that the functions you might call in\n    \"vanilla\" Processing (i.e., the Java implementation) have exactly the same\n    functionality in Processing.py..There are, however, a number of Processing\n    functions whose names conflict with existing built-in Python functions. To\n    cope with these cases, Processing.py implements special \"wrapper\" functions\n    invoke the appropriate underlying code based on the number of parameters\n    passed to the call. Here's a list of some of the affected functions:.Processing.py makes the core Processing functions available by setting\n    attributes of Jython's `__builtins__` object. If you're interested in the\n    technical details, ., and the \"wrapper\" functions are\n    implemented in ..\n\n    .To make things easier on beginner programmers, vanilla Java Processing\n    includes a number of functions for easily manipulating arrays \n    such as ., ., .,\n    ., ., etc.). For compatibility purposes,\n    Processing.py supports these functions, even though in most cases you would\n    want to use Python built-in data structures instead..If you do end up using these functions, be aware that they return\n    Python . objects, not lists. (Jython internally represents\n    Java arrays as objects of type . from Python's . module.)\n    For example, consider the following two lines of code:.In most situations, arrays and lists are interchangeable, so you might not\n    even notice. But arrays and lists have subtly different functionality,\n    which might cause bugs in your program if you're not careful. For\n    example, the following code raises a TypeError:.... because . returns a strictly-typed array of Java\n    String objects, and you can't append an integer to such an array. Likewise,\n    lists and arrays don't compare element-wise, as illustrated by the\n    following example:.Always keep an eye on the types of your variables and make sure you know\n    what you're working with. In addition to the Processing functions mentioned\n    above, there may be third-party libraries that you use in your\n    Processing.py sketch that return array types as well. Fortunately, there's\n    an easy fix: use the Python built-in . function to convert\n    the arrays into a list. For example:.Note, however, that most vanilla Java Processing function that normally\n    takes an array as a parameter will happily accept plain Python lists in\n    their stead, though they'll still return an array. So, for example:.For various reasons, Processing.py's implementation of Processing\n    functions differ in small ways from the implementation in vanilla Java\n    Processing. For the most part, these differences will be invisible to you\n    and the functions should \"just work\" as expected. Included below are a few\n    quirks that might come up..Most Processing libraries work with Processing.py out of the box. In\n    Python Mode in the Processing IDE, you can search for and add libraries to\n    your sketch using the \"Add Tool...\" dialog, just like you do with vanilla\n    Java Processing. Processing.py adds a global variable\n    . to your sketch automatically which you can pass to\n    third-party libraries that need a reference to the current sketch..Some Processing libraries want you to define functions in your sketch with particular\n    names and signatures in your sketch as callbacks or event handlers. Right\n    now, these libraries won't work in Processing.py unless specific support has been\n    added. As of this writing, full or partial support exists for \n    .,\n    .,\n    .\n    and ..

        "Hello everyone! I’m interested in learning AI development, and after doing a little bit of research, I’ve learned that . and . are the top languages for AI. Which one should I learn? What are the differences? Are they hard to learn? If anyone can help with this, it’d be very appreciated. Thank you!.Java is far more popular and you can use other JVM-based languages such as Kotlin (I would recommend Kotlin over Java). Also, for Java, there are many more libraries, tools, etc. Also, if you learn Java, you can do almost anything - mobile (Android), web, and desktop apps - without \"hacks\". There is native support for all of these..As with any programming language, it's not hard to learn the syntax but it's hard to understand the ecosystem, know libraries, best practices, etc. From that point of view, I would also prefer java - more tools, more libraries, more resources, guides, how-tos, etc. .Hi\nExcuse me if I wrote the text badly because I do not know much English\nMy suggestion is to choose Python for artificial intelligence because it has both comfortable and powerful syntax.\nPython is currently the best language for artificial intelligence\nIt is better to go and learn Python and then learn one of the artificial intelligence frameworks and enter it..I'd recommend Python due to the fact that many AI libraries and frameworks are specifically developed for the Python ecosystem. .Java is good for general purpose programming: Web, Mobile and Desktop, however doesn't really have many native libraries supporting AI Development..As for LISP, again it has some support,, however Python seems to be the leading edge in AI development.I have not much idea about Lisp, but have been a Java professional since last 20 odd years. And I would say Java along with Python is one of the best languages for AI..AI works on the concept of algorithms, and Java is algorithm based. Also Java has it's own AI libraries that can be reused. You have Java AI libraries for Expert Systems, Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing..Also Java being a widely used language, brings with it certain advantages, ease of usage, debugging, has a large user base and support groups. And above all JVM helps you to create on single app, that can run on any platform. And it's features of garbage collection, simplifying work with large scale projects makes it better..Hope this helps..Hi! I'm currently studying . for mobile apps, but I also have a demand to automate some tasks on the web and create backends' for my apps, so thinking about which one of those could be better? Considering the performance and how easy it's to learn and create stuff? (I'm already familiar with . stack but want something more \"simple\" to write).Definitely Python. Lots of libraries, dead simple syntax. Lots of code examples and reference projects. Elixir is pure functional and takes time to grasp the concepts. Go is great, with simple syntax and performant runtime, but more strict as it is statically typed. For quick coding, nothing beats Python. As you come from .net I’d consider similar approach and be considering Java with SpringBoot as it makes Java faster and much more fun to code web servers.Elixir really has a good performance for the web (and in general).\nIts framework Phoenix for the web is a great tool, easy to install and to use, with features for websockets (and Pub/Sub) or LiveView to write reactive and real time app with only HTML (and Elixir) so basically everything is in one place.It can take some time to learn a few things in Elixir but I really think it's worth it, and it's very easy to go distributed and concurrent with Elixir. Also it's easier to code quickly with some features like the pattern matching or some operators like the pipe or the capture one.And in the case you need it you can still connect and interface Python and Elixir pretty quickly, and now Elixir has a lot of different frameworks : web, embedded or even neural networks now.Never went far with Go but I have some trouble with its syntax, I find it a bit messy.I don't have a lot of experience with the web with Python but I don't have a good experience with the little I did.Hey Vitor, You can use Node and Express JS to create a backend for your app. You can create REST APIS to connect your front end with the backend. It is a very simple and scalable solution for building backend web apps. .Judging your previous experience we will benefit from Golang in terms of portability and speed. If you want to go simplier use Python. If it's only scripts use Python..What stack is a cryptocurrency exchange built upon? For example let's see Binance's page of BTC/USDT market. The order data refreshes in milliseconds, graphs refreshes in milliseconds, orders are placed in ms and everything moves well dynamically. How are they able to achieve it? What front-end framework might they be using? What backend framework for this kind of data, framework for matching engine, database for such heavy loads?.For such a more realtime-focused, data-centered application like an exchange, it's not the frontend or backend that matter much. In fact for that, they can do away with any of the popular frameworks like React/Vue/Angular for the frontend and Go/Python for the backend. For example uniswap's frontend (although much simpler than binance) is built in React. The main interesting part here would be how they are able to handle updating data so quickly. In my opinion,  they might be heavily reliant on realtime processing systems like Kafka+Kafka Streams, Apache Flink or Apache Spark Stream or similar. For more processing heavy but not so real-time processing, they might be relying on OLAP and/or warehousing tools like Cassandra/Redshift. They could have also optimized few high frequent queries using NoSQL stores like mongodb (for persistance) and in-memory cache like Redis (for further perfomance boost to get millisecond latencies)..While these tools are a great start, you are going to need low latency, and extremely high bandwidth. I couldn't see this happening without you having pretty much your own datacenter at your disposal. While the post below gives some great options, it's extremely apache-biased. Not saying apache is bad, but there are other options to explore. My recommendation is a mix of services from AWS, azure.. Whatever cloud service you choose to go with. You'll definitely need a streaming service.. Either self-built or cloud provided, and a restful API for things that don't quite require the power of a stream. Then, as you scale, you'll start to realize that even the best stacks in the world have bottlenecks, and you'll want to employ use of some type of messaging queue..I'm making my university community web service with a team. (6 members myself included) .And we decided to use ., HTML, CSS (for sure, it's the basic of websites) but couldn't decide for the back end part. .There are tons of languages, tools, etc., but I'm really new to programming, so I'd like to get some help to figure out what tools we need. .So my question is this: are there any good examples of web community services we can mimic the tools or get an insight from them? .Since you're following Python, I would recomend using Django as your main back-end language. If you know Python it would be a great experience.\nDjango is well documented on their official website:\n.\nI would also use React for front-end as well. \nAlso this article is worth reading, I think progressive web app is something worth learning these days:\n.\nHope that helps :).Since your team is already using JavaScript, there's a great number of examples for backend services written with NodeJS. I'd recommend using Firebase, or any backend as a service (you can use that term to find alternatives), for setting up your backend as it is much easier for newer people to understand and lets you focus on your core application logic, and not provisioning servers, databases, etc..Since you're team is already using JavaScript, there are alot of examples and open source projects written with NodeJs, so I preffer this language in your backend application and also I am recommended using Mongo DB with It for saving data in it, and also for your frontend application I am recommanded using VueJs..Since you are already using JavaScript on the front end it would be easy to adopt the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack which s all javascript based making it easy to transfer knowledge with the backend and front end.Make it simple, most of projects doesnt need a AI, ML or big algorithms.\nIf your project just serving end users take it to the web ready compatible. (Javascript, .Net, PHP Laravel).Kindly I don't find any help that solve this mystery I need more help if it will happen.Hello, I am interested in learning how to program. I am a beginner, and  many articles saying I should go with . if I am new to programming. I considered . a long time ago, but for my career, I believe major programming languages should be better for me. I'm considering Python at this moment, but if you have other tools I should use, let me know..The language you choose is also dependant on the type of career / area of programming you wish to focus on: Web Based and mobile applicaitons I would lean towards Java,  PC Applications I tend to like C#, \n Embedded industry C, C++.my advice , you should answer me for this question, what do you like to work: web base or mobile native or cross platform. if you like web base you should choose PHP or ASP.net or Node.js or if you like mobile native you should decide Android or IOS platform and else if you like cross platfrom you should learn Flutter with dart language.\nthanks.Hi there. I'm looking to build an employee time tracker web app. This should also be optimized for mobile. I'm trying to figure out what the best stack is for this. I have knowledge of ., ., some .. I don't mind learning a new language for this purpose. Any help or advice would be really awesome! Thanks..Hi Otensia! I'd definitely recommend using the skills you've already got and building with . is a smart way to go these days. Most platform services have JavaScript/Node SDKs or NPM packages, many serverless platforms support Node in case you need to write any backend logic, and JavaScript is incredibly popular - meaning it will be easy to hire for, should you ever need to..My advice would be \".\". If you already have a skill set that will work well to solve the problem at hand, and you don't need it for any other projects, don't spend the time jumping into a new language. If you're looking for an excuse to learn something new, it would be better to invest that time in learning a new platform/tool that compliments your knowledge of JavaScript. For this project, I might recommend using ., ., or Google . to quickly and easily deploy your web app. If you need to add user authentication, there are great examples out there for ., ., or even . (a newcomer on the Auth scene, but very user friendly). All of these services work very well with a JavaScript-based application..As you have knowledge of Javascript, I would go towards Vue/React in Frontend and Node (with suitable framework) with backend. From my point of view Java would be too bloated for suggested kind of an app. I myself use PHP as a backend a lot and React as frontend but moving thoughts towards full stack javascript world..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..php is the best for beginners, and one of the best for web development at all, all the host servers can handle it, a basic knowledge in java is not enough for build a web site, but a basic knowledge in php is enough. learn php basics and oop and mvc design pattern or any framework like Laravel (optional), and javascript for frontend (a framework like React or Angular is optional but good) and you will build any web site you want..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..For just a time tracker app? I'd recommend going with a cloud-based approach. A couple serverless functions in whatever language you choose, and the front end can be a static website hosted inside a storage service (blob for Azure, bucket for AWS, etc). This will ultimately probably save you a little time, and them a little money on hosting..Hey, 👋 .My name is Brayden. I’m currently a Frontend . Developer, striving to move into Fullstack so I can expand my knowledge. .For my main backend language, I am deciding between .. I’ve tried each of them out for about an hour and currently, I like Python and Rust the most. However, I’m not sure if I’m missing out on something!.If anyone has advice on these technologies, I’d love to hear it!.Thanks. .Rust is still in low demand. It's a great language but you'll have a hard time finding jobs. Go is the mix of both Rust and Python. Great language with modern features, fast, scalable, fun to write, and at the same time it has high demand (not as much as python)..Python on the other hand is a language that you can't go wrong with. Look around you and see what your job market prefers. If there isn't much difference to you personally, pick the one with more demand..All of these are solid options, however considering your expertise currently, I would probably suggest Node.JS considering your past experience with JS. However Python offers a similar development environment to JS in my opinion, and Go is a good sort of intermediate between Rust and Node.JS and Python. It's fast, but not as fast as Rust, and offers a development experience that combines C-styled languages (like Rust), and Python-y languages... So: Rust for the fastest, Node for familiarity, Python for ease of development, and Go for a good middle ground. I have used all in personal projects... If you use Go, I suggest a easy to use web server framework like Fiber..Rust is a challenging choice, but worth to be chosen. It has strong memory-safety and type-safety, this gives you no bother about those errors. However, static typing languages often slow our developing speed down in early stage. In that case, it's effective to write prototype in an easy language like Python, and rewrite it in a hard language. It's important not to be afraid to throw away first code you write..The other answers are excellent, but I want to be a bit of a contrarian and say you should learn Rust. While the number of jobs for it are (relatively) low(er), it is certainly expanding and you'd be surprised at which companies do use Rust (Discord, for example, is starting to move away from Golang to Rust!). .But the main reason is that learning Rust itself will teach you a lot about systems design (/backend) because of its borrow checker. You can try out a lot of ideas and make a lot mistakes and the borrow checker will always be there guide you to a better solution (thereby teaching you in the process). .Also, I wouldn't underestimated how important managing memory (and memory safety) is. While Golang is great in some ways, it doesn't protect you from pushing memory leaks into production. And eventually you'll come upon a scenario where you'll have to make your Python code run faster and the optimizations you'd have to do won't look pretty (or be very Pythontic). .And Rust is freakin fast! If you have Rust, you wouldn't need any other language for the backend (or any other systems level code). Check this blog post: .. Discord found that even after spending months optimizing Golang code it still wasn't fast enough. But unoptimized, first-draft Rust code was (is) faster by an order of magnitude! .Hi.I want to build a tool to check asset availability (video, images, etc.) from third-party vendors. These vendors have APIs. However, this process should run daily basis and update the database with the status. This is a kind of separate process. I need to know what will be the good approach and technology for this?.hi - I think this depends on how you want to provide the information to the user. \nIf you want to build a Wordpress-plugin: PHP\nIf you want to build your own website: Python+Django / PHP / JavaScript+Node.js\nAs Desktop application?.for what technologies you should use, this is depend on what technology do you prefer? your should think best structuing for your code because each API vendor has different to a nother one so it's better no merege code vendores  together.\nyour code must be using SOLID principle pattern and some design pattern such as Factory Pattern.The major advantage of Go is that you can run queries in parallel. Fire off a Go thread for each vendor and each thread can check the availability of assets from a specific vendor and update the database. Go supports hundreds of threads with ease..Hi, I would recommend Go because of strongly-typed nature which makes a developer more productive as it is less error prone compared to the other dynamic-typed language. Go also has cron-job library(powered by goroutines) that can help with your automated tasks..your decision depend on what language do you know. if you know php you can use laravel framework.I was thinking about adding a new technology to my current stack (. and .). But, I want a compiled language, mainly for speed and scalability reasons compared to interpreted languages. I have tried each one (., ., and .). I loved them, and I don't know which one can offer me more opportunities for the future (I'm in my first year of software engineering at university)..Which language should I choose?.I will highly recommend Kotlin.\nI have worked with all three intensely and so far the development speed and simplicity is the best with Kotlin.\nKotlin supports . out of the box. Now, it isn't something that can't be implemented in other languages but Kotlin makes it super easy to work with them.\nKotlin has a bit of learning curve, so, by the time you can actually use it idiomatically chances are that you will get proficient in Java too. But once you get it, you get it, then there is no other language ;)\nKotlin is backed by Google and Jetbrains team so you can expect latest programming features and good community support..As you certainly know, there are languages that compile in meta-code for Virtual Machines (Java, C#, Kotlin) and languages that compile in Machine Language (Go, Rust). Apart specific domains (blockchain, IoT embedded software, AI, cloud) almost no-one uses languages that compile in machine language, for a series of reason, most of all security and portability. So, if you are going to learn for business go with Kotlin - Java is a bit ancien regime.\nIf you seriously need to learn a language that compiles in ML - for example you will code for IoT - go with Go - or Rust - but keep in mind that Rust is much less used than Go.\nPS: Kotlin also compiles in ML, but I would choose a language designed for that, instead of one that compiles \"also\" in ML.\nPPS: Some Virtual Machines - ie: GraalVM - allow you to compile Java in ML. The world of IT is beautiful..I'd say Rust's knowledge will be more valuable in comparison. You can work in Blockchain development,  compile to WASM (WebAssembly). There is a new JavaScript/TypeScript runtime named Deno (by the creator of Node.js) that has its backend in Rust. .It depends on which level and use cases you prefer to work at. Close to the machine? Rust is great but if you need to find more job opportunities, then take C/C++. Java has many job positions but I suggest Kotlin over it. Think about it as a better Java, but fewer job positions.\nDo you want to do your own projects? So a productive language like Ruby is way better. Like to program front-end apps? Take JS.\nFind your passion..If you want a compiled language then go for Rust. It takes a certain mindset to get your head around its memory management system and the way it handles \"borrowed\" memory. However, it will generate blindingly fast code that you can cross-compile for other platforms. As a systems programming language I highly recommend it. Take time and learn it. .Java is only compiled to bytecode, not to machine code. So it executes in the Java Virtual Machine. DOn't think that its not fast, because the latest incarnation are very fast indeed. For most practical purposes, users of your code won't notice any difference. There are a heck of a lot of features in Java that you either have to import via crates in Rust, or write yoursef. So productivity-wise, Java may well beat Rust. .Kotlin is a Java-lookalike. It's a nice, and succinct version of Java and is totally interoperable. But its a bit niche, and for me it fails because my dev environment of choice (Spring Tool Suite) doesn't really play well with Kotlin. To use it you would be well advised to use iDeaj. I have used kotlin, and I like it, but not enough to ditch all my Java code. .Other contenders, depending on your platform of choice are Golang,  C, C++, and C# (available as Mono on Linux systems).  .I use Rust and Java and if you need a compiled language I recommend Rust. .I'd recommend you to take a look at Java and Kotlin, the first due to the number of companies that actively use it in your products. Kotlin is gaining adept since it is fully compatibly with the Java ecosystem but usually requires less code to do the same (ignoring other benefits of the language). Another benefits of the Kotlin is that it is in fact multiplatform, where you could use the same syntax to code for mobile, web and backend applications.\nThe drawback of Kotlin, is the number of open jobs that exists currently compared to Java, but I pretty sure that it will change in the near future..All those are nice languages, but Rust is harder to learn properly and has a smaller ecosystem. If you want to work in system programming (like hardware drivers) Rust is probably your choice. Otherwise, Java/Kotlin ecosystem is much larger and gives much more possibilities (maybe excluding low-level system programming). .When talking about Kotlin and Java, both are good. But Kotlin, again, gives much more opportunities. Kotlin-JS gives you browser applications, Kotlin-Native allows to compile to native application (and interop with them). Kotlin-WASM will be available shortly. Rust is better than Kotlin-Native for native development tight now, but not by far and it makes sense only if you are focusing only on native development..I would go with Kotlin. It is pretty hyped currently..You can use Kotlin for a lot of application types. To name some:.The code is also really concise, readable and modern. It also provides many features that you will find in many other programming languages. .I am technical support. I work daily with . / Exchange, Active directory. I would like to learn scripting and automation to make my life easier. I just started learning . but not really sure about the correct study path from where I can start. I am taking some courses on Udemy and YouTube. Is it enough? .My first foray into programming was with powershell and it continues to be an enormous help for me in my career (caveat being that I have primarily worked on windows boxes). That being said, PowerShell is a weird language that has some unique syntax and operators that don't translate well to other languages.  Python is weird too, but for other reasons (spacing!). I suspect you'll get more immediate benefit spending some time on Powershell since your working in an environment that fully supports the ps toolset. .As for learning, I read \"PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches\" and found that helpful. However, I think your course of study is sufficient.  Think the most return for the effort was just messing around in the powershell IDE on my local computer and working the Microsoft documentation. .Taking courses on Udemy and YouTube will be helpful I'm sure, but don't neglect the power of practice. If you work largely with Windows right now, pick powershell. Take opportunities to convert the knowledge you already have (example: unlocking an account in Active Directory or adding an email alias in Exchange) from a manual process to a powershell method. Sometimes that's a single cmdlet (Unlock-AdAccount) and sometimes it's a script..Once you have a good understanding of variables, the pipeline, and foreach loops, you'll be in a position to accelerate your learning. Looking up Microsoft docs is part of the process :).I would consider reading \"Powershell for sysadmins\" from No Starch Press. Start small with the ActiveDirectory and AzureAd modules. Start with read only operations like pulling AD Group Members into a variable and then pipe that variable into a .csv file with Export-CSV cmdlet. Once you feel more comfortable with the syntax, specific cmdlets, and piping data start looking at specific techniques like using hashtables (dictionaries) and globbing. From there you can begin to construct your own functions and modules. Just start small and don't let yourself get overwhelmed. .Python will be used in order to train machine learning models from our data.  We chose python for this task because it is the most common language for machine learning.  It has very performant libraries like numpy and scikit-learn that provide functionality for manipulating data and creating models that you cannot get in other languages like JavaScript and Java.  Additionally, it is the most familiar language for us to use for machine learning because almost every machine learning course teaches ml using python..Javascript will be used for both our frontend and backend on the web service.  JavaScript is ubiquitous as the language to use for the frontend.  For the backend, we decided to create our server using JavaScript because of its easy setup; using Express we can create a server in just a few short lines of code.  It is simple not only to run the server locally, but to host it as well because any major service will support the language.  JavaScript is a simple language to code in and familiar among our team members, so using it will help speed up development.  Using JavaScript allows us to use NodeJS and npm, so we can use packages to easily set up the server, connect to a database and other convenient utilities.  We also considered Python for our server.  It is also very simple to create a server in Python, especially using flask.  However, the extra familiarity with the JavaScript language and the ease of using packages were enough for us to pick JavaScript as our language of choice.. .Python is the default go-to for machine learning. It has a wide variety of useful packages such as pandas and numpy to aid with ML, as well as deep-learning frameworks. Furthermore, it is more production-friendly compared to other ML languages such as R..Pytorch is a deep-learning framework that is both flexible and fast compared to Tensorflow + Keras. It is also well documented and has a large community to answer lingering questions. .Python: The top language in machine learning area because of the various open-source libraries.

I have been working with React Native since 2016 and originally I had to use simulators in Xcode, install pods on top of node packages, configure certificates, and more abundant objectives that take time away from actual development. As a development studio, we have to move quick and get projects to our clients and partners in a matter of months..Expo made this easy for us. We now have a mobile app for clients to download and test their project on, there is no need to install pods or configure Xcode, and development is super fast and reliable now..I had a . to create the simplest accounting software for Mac and Windows to help small businesses in Canada..This led me to a long 2 years of exploration of the best language that could provide these features:.I tried Python, Java, C# and C++ without finding what I was looking for..When I discovered Javascript, I really knew it was the right language to use. Thinking of this today makes me realize even more how great a decision this has been to learn, use and master Javascript. It has been a fun, challenging and productive road on which I am still satisfied. .Obviously, when I refer to Javascript, it is not without implying the vast ecosystem around it. For me, JS is a whole universe in which almost every imaginable tools exist. It's awesome - for real. Thanks to all the contributors which have made it possible. .To be even clearer about how intense I am with Javascript, let's just say that my first passion was music. Until, I find coding with Javascript! Yep, I know!.So in conclusion, I chose Javascript because it is versatile, enjoyable, widely used, productive for both desktop softwares and websites with ability to create modern great looking user interfaces (assuming HTML and CSS are involved) and finally there are job openings..Python has become the most popular language for machine learning right now since almost all machine learning tools provide service for this language, and it is really to use since it has many build-in objects like Hashtable. In C, you need to implement everything by yourself. .C++ is one of the most popular programming languages in graphics. It has many fancy libraries like eigen to help us process matrix. I have many previous projects about graphics based on C++ and this time, we also need to deal with graphics since we need to analyze movements of the human body. C++ has much more advantages than Java. C++ uses only compiler, whereas Java uses compiler and interpreter in both. C++ supports both operator overloading and method overloading whereas Java only supports method overloading. C++ supports manual object management with the help of new and delete keywords whereas Java has built-in automatic garbage collection..Go is a way faster than both Python and PHP, which is pretty understandable, but we were amazed at how good we adapted to use it. Go was a blessing for a team , since strict typing is making it very easy to develop and control everything inside team, so the quality was really good.

        "One of the great things about Python is that all of the basic data types\nare objects. Integers are objects, floating point numbers are objects,\nlists are objects, everything. In Java that is not the case. In Java,\nsome of the most basic data types like integers and floating point\nnumbers are not objects. The benefit of having these primitive data\ntypes be non-objects is that operations on the primitives are fast. The\nproblem is that it became difficult for programmers to combine objects\nand non-objects in the way that we do in Python. So, eventually all the\nnon-object primitives ended up with Objectified versions..Primitive.Object.int.Integer.float.Float.double.Double.char.Char.boolean.Boolean.In older versions of Java, it was the programmers responsibility to\nconvert back and forth from a primitive to an object whenever necessary.\nThis process of converting a primitive to an object was called\n“boxing.” The reverse process is called “unboxing.” In Java 5, the\ncompiler became smart enough to know when to convert back and forth and\nis called “autoboxing.” In this book, we will typically use the Object\nversion of all the numeric data types and let the compiler do its thing..Let’s look at a simple Python function which converts a Fahrenheit\ntemperature to Celsius.\nIf this program were run on the command-line, you would enter the temperature when prompted – the Javascript pop-up for input is only an artifact of the digital textbook..Next, lets look at the Java equivalent. If this program were run on the command-line, you would enter the temperature when prompted – the “Input for Program” text box is only an artifact of the digital textbook..There are several new concepts introduced in this example. We will look\nat them in the following order:.Import.Variable Declaration.Input/Output and the Scanner Class.In Java, you can use any class that is available without having to import\nthe class, subject to two very important conditions:.The . and . commands must know that the class exists..You must use the full name of the class.Your first question might be how do the . and . commands\nknow that certain classes exist. The answer is the following:.Java knows about all the classes that are defined in .java and .class\nfiles in your current working directory..Java knows about all the classes that are shipped with Java..Java knows about all the classes that are included in your\n. environment variable. Your . environment\nvariable can name two kinds of structures..A .jar file that contains Java classes.Another directory that contains Java class files.You can think of the import statement in Java as working a little bit\nlike the . statement in Python. However, behind\nthe scenes, the two statements actually do very different things. The\nfirst important difference to understand is that the class naming system\nin Java is very hierarchical. The . name of the Scanner class is\nreally .. You can think of this name as having two\nparts: The first part . is called the . and the\nlast part is the .. We’ll talk more about the class naming system a\nbit later. The second important difference is that it is the Java class\nloader’s responsibility to load classes into memory, not the import\nstatement’s..So, what exactly does the import statement do? What it does is tell the\ncompiler that we are going to use a shortened version of the class’s\nname. In this example we are going to use the class\n. but we can refer to it as just .. We\ncould use the . class without any problem and\nwithout any import statement, provided that we always referred to it by\nits full name. As an experiment, you may want to try this yourself.\nRemove the import statement and change the string Scanner to\n. in the rest of the code. The program should still\ncompile and run..Here is where we run into one of the most important differences between\nJava and Python. Python is a . language. In a\ndynamically typed language a variable can refer to any kind of object at\nany time. When the variable is used, the interpreter figures out what\nkind of object it is. Java is a . language. In a\nstatically typed language the association between a variable and the\ntype of object the variable can refer to is determined when the variable\nis .. Once the declaration is made it is an error for a\nvariable to refer to an object of any other type..In the example above, lines 5—7 contain variable declarations.\nSpecifically we are saying that . and . are going to\nreference objects that are of type .. The variable . will\nreference a . object. This means that if we were to try an\nassignment like . the compiler would generate an error\nbecause . is a string and . is supposed to be a double..For Python programmers, the following error is likely to be even more\ncommon. Suppose we forgot the declaration for . and instead left\nline 6 blank. What would happen when we type . on\nthe command line?.When you see the first kind of error, where the symbol is on the left\nside of the equals sign, it usually means that you have not declared the\nvariable. If you have ever tried to use a Python variable that you have\nnot initialized the second error message will be familiar to you. The\ndifference here is that we see the message before we ever try to test\nour program. More common error messages are discussed in the section\n...The general rule in Java is that you must decide what kind of an object\nyour variable is going to reference and then you must declare that\nvariable before you use it. There is much more to say about the static\ntyping of Java, but for now this is enough..In the previous section we created a . object. In\nJava, . objects make getting input from the user, a file, or even\nover the network relatively easy. In our case we simply want to ask the\nuser to type in a number at the command line, so in line 9 we construct\na . by calling the constructor and passing it the .\nobject. Notice that this . object is assigned to the name .,\nwhich we declared to be a . on line 7. . is\nsimilar to . except, of course, it is used for input. If you\nare wondering why we must create a . to read data from\n. when we can write data directly to . using\n., you are not alone. We will talk about the reasons why this\nis so later when we talk in-depth about Java streams. You will also see\nin other examples that we can create a . by passing the . a\n. object. You can think of a . as a kind of “adapter” that\nmakes low level objects easier to use..On line 11 we use the . object to read in a number. Here again we\nsee the implications of Java being a strongly typed language. Notice\nthat we must call the method . because the variable\n. was declared as a double. So, we must have a function that is\nguaranteed to return each kind of object we might want to read. In this\ncase, we need to read a Double so we call the function .. The\ncompiler matches up these assignment statments and if you try to assign\nthe results of a method call to the wrong kind of variable it will be\nflagged as an error..The table below shows some commonly used methods of the . class. There\nare many more methods supported by this class and we will talk about how\nto find them in our chapter about ...Return type.Method name.Description.boolean.hasNext().returns true if more data is present.boolean.hasNextInt().returns true if the next thing to read is an integer.boolean.hasNextFloat().returns true if the next thing to read is a float.boolean.hasNextDouble().returns true if the next thing to read is a double.Integer.nextInt().returns the next thing to read as an integer.Float.nextFloat().returns the next thing to read as a float.Double.nextDouble().returns the next thing to read as a Double.String.next().returns the next thing to read as a String.Strings in Java and Python are quite similar. Like Python, Java strings\nare immutable. However, manipulating strings in Java is not quite as\nobvious since Strings do not support an indexing or slicing operator.\nThat is not to say that you can’t index into a Java string, you can. You\ncan also pull out a substring just as you can with slicing. The\ndifference is that Java uses method calls where Python uses operators..In fact, this is the first example of another big difference between Java\nand Python. Java does not support any operator overloading. Table 3 maps\ncommon Python string operations to their Java counterparts. For the\nexamples shown in the table we will use a string variable called “str”.Python.Java.Description.Return character in 3rd  position.Return substring from 2nd up to but not including 4th.Return the length of the string.Find the first occurrence of x.Split the string on whitespace into a list/array of strings.Split the string at . into a list/array of strings. or .Concatenate two strings together.Remove any whitespace at the beginning or end.Next, let’s look at a program which reads numbers from a file and produces a histogram showing the frequency of the numbers.\nThe data file we will use has one number between 0 and 9 on each line of the file.\nHere is a simple Python program that creates and prints a histogram..Test running the program. It will read this data:.Lets review what is happening in this little program. First, we create a list\nand initialize the first 10 positions in the list to be\n0. Next we open the data file called ‘test.dat’. Third, we have a loop\nthat reads each line of the file. As we read each line we convert it to\nan integer and increment the counter at the position in the list\nindicated by the number on the line we just read. Finally we iterate\nover each element in the list, printing out both the position in the list\nand the total value stored in that position..To write the Java version of this program we will have to introduce\nseveral new Java concepts. First, you will see the Java equivalent of a\nlist, called an . Next, you will see three different kinds\nof loops used in Java. Two of the loops we will use are going to be very\nfamiliar, the third one is different from what you are used to in Python\nbut is easy when you understand the syntax:.The . will be repeatedly executed until the . becomes false..The . will be repeatedly executed until the . becomes false. As shown in the example below, the . and . make this form useful for iterating over a range of numbers, similar to how you might use . in Python..The . will be executed once for each element in the .. Each execution, . will be assigned to the next element of .. Known as the “for-each” loop. This form is useful for iterating over members of a collection, similar to how you might use . in Python..Here is the Java code needed to write the exact same program:.Before going any further, I suggest you try to compile the above program\nand run it on some test data that you create..Now, let’s look at what is happening in the Java source. As usual, we\ndeclare the variables we are going to use at the beginning of the\nmethod. In this example we are declaring a . variable called .,\nan integer called . and an . called .. However, there\nis a new twist to the . declaration. Unlike Python where\nlists can contain just about anything, in Java we let the compiler know\nwhat kind of objects our array list is going to contain. In this case\nthe . will contain .. The syntax we use to declare\nwhat kind of object the list will contain is the .\nsyntax..Technically, you don’t . to declare what is going to be in an array\nlist. The compiler will allow you to leave the .>`` off the\ndeclaration. If you don’t tell Java what kind of object is going to be\non the list Java will give you a warning message like this:.Without the . part of the declaration Java simply assumes that\n. object can be on the list. However, without resorting to an ugly\nnotation called casting, you cannot do anything with the objects on a\nlist like this! So, if you forget you will surely see more errors later\nin your code. (Try it and see what you get).Lines 13—20 are required to open the file. Why so many lines to open a\nfile in Java? The additional code mainly comes from the fact that Java\nforces you to reckon with the possibility that the file you want to open\nis not going to be there. If you attempt to open a file that is not\nthere you will get an error. A try/catch construct allows us to try\nthings that are risky, and gracefully recover from an error if one\noccurs. The following example shows the general structure of a try/catch\nblock..Notice that in line 16 we are catching an .. In fact, we\nwill see later that we can have multiple catch blocks to catch different\ntypes of exceptions. If we want to be lazy and catch any old exception\nwe can catch an . which is the parent of all exceptions.\nHowever, catching . is a terrible practice, since you may inadvertently catch exceptions you do not intend to, making it harder to identify bugs in your program..On line 22 we create our . and give it an initial size of 10.\nStrictly speaking, it is not necessary to give the . any\nsize. It will grow or shrink dynamically as needed, just like a list in\nPython. On line 23 we start the first of three loops. The for loop on\nlines 23–25 serves the same purpose as the Python statement\n., that is it initializes the first 10 positions in the\n. to hold the value 0..The syntax of this for loop probably looks very strange to you, but in\nfact it is not too different from what happens in Python using range. In\nfact . is exactly equivalent to the\nPython . The first statement inside the parenthesis\ndeclares and initializes a loop variable .. The second statement is a\nBoolean expression that is our exit condition. In other words we will\nkeep looping as long as this expression evaluates to true. The third\nclause is used to increment the value of the loop variable at the end of\niteration through the loop. In fact . is Java shorthand for\n. Java also supports the shorthand . to decrement the\nvalue of i. Like Python, you can also write . as shorthand for\n. Try to rewrite the following Python for loops as Java for\nloops:. [hint, you can\nseparate statements in the same clause with a ,].The next loop (lines 27–30) shows a typical Java pattern for reading\ndata from a file. Java while loops and Python while loops are identical\nin their logic. In this case, we will continue to process the body of the\nloop as long as . returns true..Line 29 illustrates another important difference between Python and\nJava. Notice that in Java we can not write\n.. This is because in Java there is no\noverloading of operators. Everything except the most basic math and\nlogical operations is done using methods. So, to set the value of an\n. element we use the . method. The first parameter of\n. indicates the index or position in the . we are\ngoing to change. The next parameter is the value we want to set. Notice\nthat, once again, we cannot use the indexing square bracket operator to\nretrieve a value from the list, but we must use the . method..The last loop in this example is similar to the Python for loop where\nthe object of the loop is a Sequence. In Java we can use this kind of\nfor loop over all kinds of sequences, which are called Collection\nclasses in Java. The for loop on line 33 . is\nequivalent to the Python loop . This loop iterates\nover all of the elements in the ArrayList called count. Each time\nthrough the loop the Integer variable . is bound to the next element of\nthe .. If you tried the experiment of removing the\n. part of the . declaration you probably noticed\nthat you had an error on this line. Why?.As I said at the outset of this section, we are going to use Java\n. because they are easier to use and more closely match the\nway that Python lists behave. However, if you look at Java code on the\ninternet or even in your Core Java books you are going to see examples\nof something called arrays. In fact you have already seen one example of\nan array declared in the ‘Hello World’ program. Lets rewrite this\nprogram to use primitive arrays rather than array lists..The main difference between this example and the previous example is\nthat we declare . to be an . of integers. We also can initialize\nshort arrays directly using the syntax shown on line 8. Then notice that\non line 22 we can use the square bracket notation to index into an\narray..Just as Python provides the dictionary when we want to have easy access\nto key-value pairs, Java also provides us a similar mechanism. Rather\nthan the dictionary terminology, Java calls these objects Maps. Java\nprovides two different implementations of a map, one is called the\n. and the other is called a .. As you might guess\nthe . uses a balanced binary tree behind the scenes, and the\n. uses a hash table..Lets stay with a simple frequency counting example, only this time we\nwill count the frequency of words in a document. A simple Python program\nfor this job could look like this:.Notice that the structure of the program is very similar to the numeric\nhistogram program..Improve the program above to remove the punctuation.",

        " ., 7 years of experience in all types of automation and manual testing in Python, Java and Ruby in Silicon Valley. Co-author and teacher of the . and . courses..Here at QA School Careerist.co we often hear disputes over which programming language is worth learning to get to work faster in Test Automation – Java or Python? This is a long-standing dispute which will hardly be resolved in the near future. Our teachers are fluent in both Java and Python, so we could teach both of these languages, but we chose Python for our students to be learnt and decided not to teach Java at all. Read on to understand why..Just want to let Java fans know that in our analysis the evaluation criteria were determined by the main goal of our course:.Just want to let Java fans know that in our analysis the evaluation criteria were determined by the main goal of our course:.In order to teach you how to automate web testing well, you need to understand the vocabulary of the programming language, how to work with Selenium, learn to read HTML and CSS to find locators, get familiar with Git, the basics of CI and reports generation..This is too much and difficult for people who often do not have any programming experience. At the same time, we do not want a person to memorize definitions, cramming constructions and solutions to algorithms for the interview. We want students to understand exactly what they do..So, one of the key criteria for choosing a language is learning simplicity. Python is easier and faster to learn for a beginner as the first programming language, and most importantly, to figure it out, and not just learn some constructions by heart. Just google “easiest programming language to learn” and make sure that Python is the top line. For example, in . of nearly a thousand programmers, HTML came first, Python came second, and JavaScript came third with a significant lag behind Python.. of an authoritative blog Automation Panda says that Python suits best for test automation – everything is simpler, clearer, easier to maintain, there are lots of libraries with ready-made solutions, and the Pytest Framework is generally perfect and quickly mastered..Pytest is one of the best frameworks for testing among all possible frameworks in all programming languages. It handles any functional tests: unit, integration and end-to-end. Test cases are written just like functions, i.e. without side effects, since global variables are excluded, and can accept parameterized inputs..Fixtures is a versatile, frequently used way for setup and cleanup functions. The main “assert” operators have an automatic introspection system, so error messages are always clear. Tests can be sorted during the execution,. Plugins extend Pytest ability to cover code, run tests simultaneously, use Gherkin scripts, and integrate with other frameworks such as Django and Flask. Other Python test frameworks are cool too, but Pytest is definitely the best..Although Python is great for beginners, it's not a toy, it's one of the most popular programming languages ​​in the world. It is always in the top of TIOBE, Stack Overflow and GitHub (also GitHut), as this is the favorite choice of lots of experts. The Python community is also pushing it forward..Python development is easy to scale thanks to well-designed syntax, good structure, modularity, and a various ecosystem of tools and packages. A variety of command line methods allows you to fit into any tool or workflow. The fact that the code written in Python can run slower than a code in some other languages ​​is not a problem for functional tests, since system delays (response time for a Web page or REST calls) are much slower than optimal productivity in terms of a language..The next key point is the demand for a specialist in the market, i.e. the number of vacancies. According to Indeed.com (.):.Let’s check that on one more popular job search site: Dice.com:.At first sight, there are slightly more Java vacancies, but if you specify the criteria Python AND Automation and Java AND Automation in the search, we get:.It is important to understand not only the number of vacancies, but also the number of potential competitor candidates for each place. We see approximately the same number of vacancies in Java and Python, however, there are usually more job applicants in Automation in Java! .Below there is the number of resumes posted by job applicants on one of the most popular job search sites Indeed.com (for the last 3 months, all the figures are actual at the time of writing):.There are hundreds of job seekers in the market, for example, from sunny India, where all, as one, know Java well, or just say so. In our opinion, it is easier to find a job and get good money with Python, since the number of vacancies is almost the same in both Python and Java, but there are fewer competitors in Python..There is an opinion that it is necessary not only to automate tests, but also to understand the developers’ code. Is it? The code can be neither in Java nor in Python at all. Imagine the situation, you spent an extra year and learnt Java to “understand the development code”, started working, and the company’s back-end is written in Scala, and the front-end is in JavaScript / React. And you won’t understand most of the things, knowing only the language – you need to know the frameworks. In 99% of cases the tester should neither check, nor even see the developers’ code..Such tests as integration, end-to-end, system, acceptance, regression, performance usually refer to high-level functional tests and often suit best from the black box perspective, so they do not have to be written in the same language as the tested product..People say that if you learn Java, then it’s easier to become a developer. But Java for QA and for development are two different levels of the language with their own characteristics. This also applies to Python: initially it is simple, difficulties can arise only when going deeper, but the language is well structured. First of all, you need to understand the algorithms, OOP and practice. After you learn Python and get a job, you can learn Java or something else that will be interesting or necessary for a specific project. The salaries in Test Automation and Software Development, on average, are almost the same, therefore, perhaps this point will generally be irrelevant for most readers..However, in terms of analyzing programming languages ​​according to different criteria, pay attention to this matrix and . from the Automation Panda blog:.We think that Python is the best language for Test Automation according to the criteria above..Java is also a good choice, and the arguments in favor of Java should also be considered, here you can not settle the dispute between fans of Python and Java. However, as teachers, we obviously advise beginners to learn automation in Python, since this way is more likely to be successful for the most, especially because of the Python simplicity learning..We do not claim that the way to learn Java as the first programming language is wrong, just from our point of view, a school one’s, it is longer, more complicated and easier to get confused with Java. Automation is taught everywhere in different ways too, we often see that students are overloaded with optional knowledge, which is better to master after getting a job, which in our opinion will definitely cause a mess in the head..Our goal as a school teaching automation is to speed up a one’s salary of more than $ 115,000 a year and maximize the chances of getting a job within 2–4 months from the beginning of the course.",

According to the latest TIOBE Programming Community Index, Java is more popular amongst the developers..At present, developers use . for developing a wide variety of desktop and web applications.  Both programming languages are widely used for data science and machine learning..However, unlike ., . is one of the two official programming languages for Android. Java was designed to help .in building software applications that can be implemented with minimal dependencies.  Whereas Python is the only programming language with a design philosophy emphasized code readability..Hence, it is essential for programmers to understand the main differences between . .Both . come under the category of high-level programming languages. However, Python is an interpreted programming language. Developers who work on Python are obliged to use operating system specific . interpreters to execute the Python code directly. They can even choose from the several implementations of programming language..In contrast to this, . is a compiled programming language. Java code is initially compiled into bytecode that runs on any platform with Java Virtual Machine. The developers can port the compiled Java code from one platform to another seamlessly..One of the most important differences between . is that Java is statically typed whereas Python is dynamically typed. This means that in Python, it is not necessary to write declare the type of a variable when writing code. Python is known for being short and readable. It allows the developer to do some things with just a few lines of code..Being dynamically typed and concise, it is easy to develop applications in . swiftly than in Java. People claim that the developer can be up to 10 times more productive while writing code in Python. Despite this, Java is less prone to bugs than Python owing to its static type system.. and ., both the language, offer an efficiency boost with a wide variety of web development frameworks such as Spring and Django. This enables developers to quickly build everything whether it is a small web app or a high traffic application..Java has compiled language whereas . is interpreted. This means that if speed is what you want from your project, then neither of the languages stands to fulfill your goal. However, Java has the edge in most environments..But, speed is a relative factor. If Python’s speed makes it an undesirable language, the other benefits, such as the rapid development process can outweigh this negative point..It is important to note here that it is possible to achieve C-like performance with the use of Cython, a popularly used superset of Python for machine learning algorithms.. both are open-source language with a large, vibrant community which contribute to the languages and offer huge support..Both languages come with an extensive array of libraries, which are supported by a large number of skilled developers. If you are not able to do something within the language itself, you will surely find a library for it..While . and . share many similarities and have a diverse range of uses, it would be wrong to say that they suit equally for any type of project. In addition to comparing the general pros and cons of each language, it is also important to consider the specific needs of your application to make sure you choose the best language.. is a highly preferred language when the speed of development and budget are primary concerns to your project. Python is dynamically typed, and along with this, it also has concise code and a myriad of frameworks available which aids in building and deploying the application in record time. Apart from this, it also has the benefit of lowering development costs..This is particularly valuable when you want to release an app under the MVP model or build and test prototypes..One of the major drawbacks of . is that it is not native to the mobile environment. Neither of the major mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS, supports Python as an official programming language. No doubt, an application can be developed in Python; however, it will require more effort on the part of the developer to deliver a rich user experience..Java, on the other hand, is one of the preferred languages, when it comes to Android app development..For developing applications, which is needed to be highly secure, Java is a preferred language. Although an experienced and skilled programmer can develop a very secure app in Python, . is widely used for banking and other such web applications due to its strength in security and functionality..Java includes access to security features such as access control, advanced authentication and cryptography that keeps your web application is secure..A combination of highly powerful specialized libraries and flexibility means that Python is the way to go when it comes to a project that is biased towards deep learning, machine learning, data science, and image recognition.. and Java are two highly popular programming language which is similar in many ways. However, that does not mean that both equal suits for every project. Weigh the pros and cons of each language, match its strength, then select the best language for your app.. stands out when it comes to developer productivity as it enables the rapid development of applications. Java has the edge when it comes to speed. And, both languages benefit from active and supportive developer communities, as well as a huge array of libraries..In terms of ideal use cases, Java is better suited for mobile app development, being one of the preferred programming languages for Android. It is a highly regarded language for banking applications where security is a major concern.. is perfect for projects where budget and speed of development are major concerns. It is best suited for applications that are built and deployed under the MVP model..Onboard . to your project as quickly as in 2 days.

        "As a beginner, it might be overwhelming to decide on which language to choose while getting into the coding world. Among several options, Java and Python are two programming languages that are widely used. However, It might be hard to pick one. This Java vs Python blog is meant to help you evaluate them and decide on what might work best for you. .: According to ., “Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have a few implementation dependencies as possible. It was developed so that developers code once and use it across different platforms. This is popularly known as Write Once, Run Anywhere(WORA)”..Describing itself as a language of possibility, Java’s official website makes a strong case for learning Java. Commonly used for developing web apps, cloud-based solutions, and desktop applications, Java is currently being used by close to 12 million developers and considered to be the #1 programming language for the cloud..: According to ., “Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python’s design philosophy emphasizes code readability through the use of significant whitespace”. .Python website describes it as powerful, fast and collaborative. It was developed as an open-source language and hence the strength of python lies in its similarity to English language and ease of coding for developers.. runs in over 3 billion devices globally & there are 12 million Java developers worldwide. This simply means it is being used by almost everyone you might know and has a thriving community to support it..One of the advantages of Java is that it is known for its innovation and resilience to change while being implemented across different platforms and spans various industries The language has been around for 24 years, which speaks a lot about its complex structure and supreme flexibility.  . being open-source is ideal for all collaborative works. This is one of the major reasons for its widespread use in AI, ML, Data Science, and Automation. Similar to Java, Python has a loyal community of developers and even fans, if you will. However, Python differs from Java in terms of loose syntax and ease of coding.. Both languages work well in . and lack behind in game development. Remembering this would help you when developing applications..In Java vs Python, Java executes faster than Python. Python is dynamically typed ( i.e without specifying any datatype) and does not demand too many syntax restrictions (think semicolon at the end of a line). Python is regarded as easier to code and learn..Works across browsers, operating systems, and machines.Portability is one of the key metrics to gauge how quickly a programming language can adapt to change and rapidly progress. Java is more flexible and portable having seen a huge wave of changes from 1995 to date. It is no wonder why Java is being learned by more than 5 million students today. Python, however, adapts differently as it is useful for shifting legacy systems and makes the process simple and efficient.. – Handling ever-increasing workload with ease.Any business owner might be aware of what are commonly referred to as “growing pains”. What happens when you have workloads overwhelming the available resources? This is why scalability is such a critical component in software development..There are two ways to work through this problem. One method is multithreading which encourages running several processes in parallel. Java uses multithreading better than Java. However, Python takes a different approach, multitasking. Multitasking enforces the idea of using a single thread for several tasks. .The structure of statements in a programming language.The difference between Java and Python is quite striking. Python is much easier to understand and code. However, Java is easier to test and debug..Look at this sample code for print statements..\n\nSystem.out.println(“Hello World”);\n\n.\n\n print (“Hello World”) \n\n.In OOPS, we use objects to access members of a class and all the member variables and functions are declared inside a class. In Java, we need to first declare a variable before it can be defined. In Python, we can do this at one go.public class MyFirstJavaProgram {.   /* This is my first java program..    * This will print ‘Hi Samco’ for 5 times as the output.    */.   public static void main(String []args) {.       for(int x=0; x < 5; x++){.           System.out.println(“Hi Samco”);.       }.       }.}.: .#print text 5X.for x in range(0,5):. print(“Samco”).According to .’s annual Developer Survey 2019, Python is comfortably poised to stay at the top of the loved and wanted list for developers and all respondents around the world. With the demand for cloud solutions and mobile apps explode, the opportunities for Python developers are becoming abundant. In the US, with a pay scale of $118k per year, Python developers are in high demand..The pictures look somewhat flat for a Java developer. Though it has a pay scale of $116k per year, Java as a language is losing out in terms of popularity and likability. However, what seems to work for Java is its range of use-cases and cross-industry appeal. Java is still highly relevant and has the backing of a strong community.. As noted by Stack Overflow, the popularity of a programming language does not necessarily reflect its usability and application. .Suggested Read: .We hope we have highlighted some of the key factors behind choosing one language among Java vs  Python. But its smart to know when to use which language based on your business needs. As with any good habit, programming is a skill acquired through constant effort and practice. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, the only way to grow is to put in consistent and disciplined work.

        "The idea of having Python as a first programming language has a rational background. First of all, the syntax of Python is short and clear and the underlying model of objects and variables working is perfectly consistent. That means you can write “real” and pretty powerful applications without great effort. So there is nothing strange that many schools teach students programming using Python..However, knowing two languages is always better than one. If you are thinking of learning a second language after Python, Java could be a really nice choice. In this article, we are going to discuss switching from Python to Java in the case of a beginner software developer..There are lots of different popular languages such as C++, C#, JavaScript… and there are pros and cons in learning any of them. So why Java? Here are some thoughts..You may use one of the course Java for beginners (it will be fast and easy for you) or Java for Python software developers. For example:.It could be easy coding tasks you did while your studying or your pet projects if you did them. Just rewrite it in Java. It is very useful..First, you may read some articles about JVM, Memory management, Garbage collection in Java:.I came across the opinion that Java is a relic of the past, and Python is modern and progressive very often. It’s funny, especially when you consider that Python is a little bit older than Java. Of course, Python overtook its time. You may say, Java “shot” immediately, became popular quickly, while Python did it very gradually, and only now began to catch up with Java in terms of prevalence. They both took serious changes through the years becoming better for modern programming and keeping their advantages. I want to say they both have strong and weak sides, and it is not about progressivity. Here I am going to describe real and the most important differences between the languages..Java is a statically typed, while Python is dynamically typed. This is the main difference between the topic’s languages. Technically it means that in Python you create your variables and don’t define their type. Types are defined only at runtime and the only condition for not having a runtime bug is to support the operations you used to the variables. So, if we have two objects such as Bird and Dog and give them a command to move fast before we run the program they are both the same. However, if we did everything right at runtime first will fly and the second will run. In Java, the Dog “knows” that it is a dog before runtime because it was defined by a programmer. You write more in Java while your computer has less work..Python was created keeping short syntax and readability in mind. Java is more about the strict structure and staying away from accidental mistakes. Classical example:.\n.Java is a compiled language and Python is interpreted. It is a simplification to say like this, however it is close to the truth..Anyway during the execution Python code is interpreted at runtime. Java code is compiled into bytecode of JVM at compile-time and JVM runs it..Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a powerful tool to create portable cross-platform applications. These applications can run on any device with JVM installed. Python compiler converts code into a specific machine code that depends on the operating system..Multithreading in Java realized much better than in Python (here we are talking about standard CPython). Memory management in Python is not thread-safe, hence, the language’s implementation prevents the multithreaded execution of Python bytecode..In Python, there is the global interpreter lock or GIL and this mutex prevents multiple threads from execution in Python. So, the only multithreading option of Python is access to IO resources. So, Python lets bytecode execution of the second thread while the first one should wait for the data from the network or file system..A Java process successfully uses multiple cores and hyperthreading. Thread safety guarantees hide not inside the language, but it in many thread-safe tools to make it an easy process..Usually, the evolution of a programming language involves backward compatibility. However, this does not apply fully to Python. Python 2 came about in 2000, and Python 3 hit the scene in 2008. They are more or less compatible but have enough differences in functionality and syntax, so that in principle they can be considered as different languages. Instead of modifying new trends and ideas in Python 2, Python 3 was conceived as a new language that somewhat used the experience of Python 2. The development of Python 2 continued separately, and its final implementation (version 2.7) will support only to 2020..Java was created with keeping backward compatibility in mind. Is this good or bad? This approach has led to a huge legacy codebase. On the other hand, this ancient code can be gradually updated, and the risks that the “veteran” will not start in the modern environment in the case of Java are minimized..I described some of the main differences, but hardly mentioned what they lead to. At this point, I promise to fix it and talk about what these differences influence, from the point of view of a software developer..The shorter syntax is the faster the developer can write it. In Python, you shouldn’t write all these brackets and classes and even variable types so… yes, Python programmers work faster than Java developers, especially in small teams with short programs and scripts. Java is verbose, yet very well structured. Therefore….…therefore the analysis and support of Java code is much easier than Python’s especially in case of huge projects. In Python lack of type information turns such analysis into a hard problem. Moreover, Java provides type safety and catches all potential errors at compile-time, not at runtime, like Python. So, the probability of errors tends to be reduced. It seriously simplifies the management of large applications. Runtime errors are more difficult to identify and fix than errors during compilation..In the case of Python, you do less, but the computer does more. In Java, everything is upside down compared to Python. So, because of all these statics and compilation instead of dynamic typing and interpretation, Java is working much faster. That means your Java program will execute in a shorter period of time and operations will work faster as well. It is not always a noticeable difference for the user. However, sometimes it could be critical..Professional software developers don’t always get to choose what tools to use. Times are changing the preferences of employers that may change along with them. The good news is that the tools are much more alike than they may seem. And Java is a good and powerful one even if after Python it seems too verbose..Enjoy this post?

        "On January 25, 2021, Penn Engineering Online Learning launched a new Specialization on Coursera called .. This Specialization moves quickly; it starts out by teaching basic concepts in Python and ramps up to more complex subjects such as object-oriented programming and data structures in Java. By the time learners complete this series of four courses, they will be able to write fully-functional programs in both Python and Java, two of the most well-known and frequently used programming languages in the world today..Introduction to Programming with Python and Java is for students and professionals who have minimal or no prior programming exposure. It’s for motivated learners who have experience with rigorous coursework, and are looking to gain a competitive edge in advancing their career. It’s for folks who are thinking about applying to the University of Pennsylvania’s popular . and want to sample some of the lecture videos and content from the first course in the program. The Specialization certificate will be viewed favorably by the admissions committee so be sure to mention it in your application. If admitted, MCIT Online students can get reimbursed for the Specialization..Why should you consider taking Introduction to Programming with Python and Java? “Programming will be a transformational force in nearly every industry in the foreseeable future,” says course instructor Brandon Krakowsky, Lecturer for Penn Engineering. “With this Specialization, anyone with determination can quickly get up to speed.” Learners will encounter in-depth coding demonstrations, hands-on coding exercises and assignments with real-world applications..The four courses in the series are:.Get started today!",
        "Find centralized, trusted content and collaborate around the technologies you use most..Q&A for work.Connect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search..I had this question in an online assessment and couldn't figure out an optimal solution. I wrote what I tried at the bottom of this post. Here's a summary of the question:.A caching system uses priority to decide what memory items are moved from main memory to cache. You are given an input array in the format < time accessed > < item ID >..Case 1 input array: .Items start at priority 0, and minimum priority is 0. Every time an item is accessed, priority increases by 2 (if accessed twice in the same second, priority increases by 4). Every second that passes without the item being accessed, its priority decreases by 1. If an item's priority is > 5, add it to the cache. If priority falls <= 3, remove it from the cache..Return items that are in the cache at the end.For case 1, 2 should be returned because item 2 has a priority 6 at the end, and item 1 has a priority 2 at the end..What I tried: I created a hashmap with keys as item ids and values as a list of times, and looped through each time, checking if every item had been accessed at every time. But I'm looking for a more efficient solution, and assuming it should use priority queues. I use Python for online assessments but since this is a priority queue question Java might be better for it?.Someone explained the answer to me. Creating a hash map was a good first step, but there's no need to go through each time step individually in a loop. If an item is accessed at times [6, 7, 20, 50], we know that it will not be in the cache at the end because at time 50 its priority will be 2..We can calculate the current priority with this formula.Loop through each item and do this, and also check the priority at the end time of the simulation, not just the last time step of each item.\r\n                                                By clicking “Post Your Answer”, you agree to our ., . and .\n.\r\n                        Your privacy\r\n                    .\r\n                        By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our ..\r\n                    ",

Python is an interpretive language that is accompanied by elegant syntax, and it makes an excellent choice for scripting and rapid application development in many areas..It is a dynamically typed programming language. There is no need to declare variables. Whereas Java is a statistically typed programming language in which variables have to be explicitly stated..Python code is too small even though some Java  “Class shell  “is not listed. This could be one reason why python could be more productive..The meaning of Java was to be WORA (write once run anywhere). It was designed to run with the help of a Java Virtual machine (JVM) on any platform and with as few dependencies as possible..The syntax is also inspire by some languages such as Algolol, Pascal, and ABC and it meant readable and clean..Before start learning Python Vs Java you should have to know about the Definition of Java and Python or some basic knowledge about both programming languages..Java is the best programming language used by most enterprises. It is a general-purpose, object-oriented language, and class-based language. Java was created by James Gosling in 1995 at Sun Microsystem, after that, it was handled by Oracle in 2009..Java is mostly used because of features and one of them is ” It writes once and runs anywhere”. This means Java works on several platforms that support Java. JVM is used where java does not work..Python is the future language, in the future everything becomes automated and python is the best language for automation. In python, you can write the big program more shortly because of its easy syntax and Big community. This language is very interactive so you can easily make several programming Software by Python. .The Syntax emphasizes readability is easy to understand in Python and it reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python also allows the developer to reuse the code by supporting some modules and packages..From the above discussion, we can conclude that Java Vs Python is its own advantages of both languages. In contrast, it’s really up to you to choose the particular language for your project. .Where Python is simple and concise, Java is quick and more portable. While Python code is dynamically coded, Java is static-coded. Python is perfect, but if we say Python is the future and is the emerging language then we have to agree that Java exists, API uses most Java..Python is easy to learn, Python language is used by most of the developers due to its short coding techniques..Java has an independent platform, this feature makes Java widely used.

        "I have been studying programming for the last six months. For the first four months I studied Python, and then I started studying studying data structures and algorithms. For data structures and algorithms, I picked the books where the code was written in Python. Now that I am about to finish that, I have decided to pick Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick. In this book all the code is written in Java..I want to learn both Java and Python, and I will learn Java at some point. My question is whether I should start learning it right now or not? I know it's not necessary, but I think it will be much easier to follow the book if I have some understanding of Java..Why am I confused?.Well, I have watched videos, read blogs about people recommending to stick to one language when starting out. So, I am scared to start a new language thinking I might forget Python or get into a situation where I don't understand either of these languages..i always say programming is the skill, and the language is the tool. choose the right tool for the job. you can hammer in a nail with a screwdriver, but its gonna be a whole lot harder. also it doesnt help to learn how to use a hammer if you have a screw. important is that you learn how to work with your hands (aka aquire skill)..algorithms and datastructures translate into any language, some make it easier, some make it harder, others already have ready made solutions or there are libraries..Exactly this. I'm writing enterprise Java code on a Federal Government contract right now and hadn't touched Java while working my career. We studied with it like 15 years ago in school. I walked into this project hammering out features because I know the algorithms, patterns, and structures. All I needed to do was brush up on syntax and what libraries are available because like you said, the language is the tool..deleted.Use the algorithm book you got, and do the examples in Python..You’ll pick up some Java doing so..Then, go back to your Python books and do the exercises in Java..Now this sounds interesting. I hadn't thought of this tactic before. Updoot to you. Cheers..This is bad advice. Stick to one dont jump around. U wont get anything don3.Java for job opportunities.Python isn't a bad choice tho.Python jobs around me are very rare to come by... But I will say that in the dev jobs I've had, I still use python a fair amount for making quick little helper scripts. So it's definitely one of the more useful languages to know, but yeah not great for finding work.Yeah shit jobs.From what I can understand I think you can say that you're at least fluent in Python. 6 month and  data structures and algorithms sounds pretty good!.I suggest you to start learn Java. You're not going too forget Python. At most you will forget the syntax, but there's the internet for that :).Programming is like riding a bike or skiing, once you have learned it you don't really forget it, you just need some time to remember..Java is quite a different beast than Python. It would be good to learn a major programming language like Java, C#, C++, etc..What about C?? Do you think there is a need/opportunities for it?.Yeah, python small as frick.I’m a little biased because I hate java, but here goes..People are saying do java for the job opportunities. There are a lot of job opportunities for Python developers as well, and the Java market is and always will be overcrowded. People also are saying to learn an OOP (object oriented programming) language, but python has that functionality as well..If you really want to challenge yourself and learn something new and useful, I recommend C or C++. Then, you’ll learn pointers, which is necessary for data structures (like a linked list). From C or C++ you can learn pretty much any imperative programming language easily..Python is regularly rated as one of the most in demand languages nowadays so he'll have some good job opportunities regardless..Depends where you live. I interviewed at maybe 20 different places before I got my job, and exactly one required python experience. And that was more sysadmin than developer. Everything I saw was Java or C# (.NET), with the occasional C++ listing in the mix. This is in the Detroit area..Python is useful to know, but almost certainly won't get me a job in this area. C is good to know also but again most likely won't directly contribute to getting a job. Java, Javascript, C#, and C++ are by far more essential than Python or C..I love Python and also hate Java but I really don't see how the job market is even close to comparable.Learn Java. Learning OOP concepts is useful for your career, AND for your engineering skills..Every language I've learnt made me a better programmer. You'll notice the things you like/dislike about a language when you try it..That allows you to build a stronger understanding of computer science as a whole. You'll see that each language tries to solve different problems, and that there's no such thing as a better language..Obviously you don't want to learn all languages. Try to pick up languages with different paradigms. Python's good for learning dynamic interpreted languages. Javas good for learning strongly typed OOP principles. C++ is good for understanding how computers really work due to it's low level nature. Throw in a functional programming language and you've covered your bases..I kinda went on a tangent there, don't bother with C++ or anything else, just saying it's a solid move to learn new languages..Members.Online",

        "I wrote this little piece a long time ago — it was last updated in May 2007.  In 2009 I moved it from my website to this blog.  At this point I consider it an historical artifact, in the sense that I consider it frozen; I’m no longer going to update it when, for example, Java acquires a new programmer-friendly feature..During the years when it was on my web site, I received a number of email comments.  I responded to them all, but no one — other than their authors and me — ever saw the comments and my responses. By moving this piece onto a blog, I hope that folks who feel like commenting can do so more easily, and can share their comments with a wider audience..During the years when it was on my web site, virtually all of the comments that I received were from Java programmers.  Some were calm and helpful, pointing out (for example) new programmer-friendly features of Java.  Many were hot and angry and accused me of writing the piece for the sole purpose of bad-mouthing Java.  If this describes you, please don’t fire off your angry counter-blast immediately.  Go away, calm down, come back and read it again carefully..I was recently asked if I still hold the opinions that I expressed in this article.  I think that’s worth talking about… but in another post..— Steve Ferg.Note that this post has  . on the concepts of weak vs. strong, and static vs. dynamic, typing in programming languages. .How much more productive? The most widely accepted estimate is .. On the basis of my own personal experience with the two languages, I agree with this estimate..Managers who are considering adding Python to their organization’s list of approved development tools, however, cannot afford to accept such reports uncritically. They need evidence, and some understanding of . programmers are making such claims. This page is for those managers..On this page, I present a list of side-by-side comparisons of features of Java and Python. If you look at these comparisons, you can see why Python can be written much more quickly, and maintained much more easily, than Java. The list is not long — it is meant to be representative, not exhaustive..This page looks only at programmer productivity, and does not attempt to compare Java and Python on any other basis. There is, however, one related topic that is virtually impossible to avoid. Python is a . language, and this feature is an important reason why programmers can be more productive with Python; they don’t have to deal with the overhead of Java’s .. So the debates about Java/Python productivity inevitably turn into debates about the comparative advantages and drawbacks of . — or . — in programming languages. I will not discuss that issue here, other than to note that in the last five years a number of influential voices in the programming community have been expressing serious doubts about the supposed advantages of static typing..For those who wish to pursue the matter, . is a good place to start. See also Bruce Eckel’s weblog discussion . and Robert C. Martin’s weblog discussion .. For background, see one of the papers that started it all in 1998 — . by John Ousterhout..Several of these discussions contain valuable comparisons of Java and Python. For other language comparisons, see the ., and the . page at .Finally, it is important to note that asserting that a programmer can be more productive in Python than in Java, is . the same as asserting that one ought always to use Python and never to use Java.  Programming languages are tools, and different tools are appropriate for different jobs. It is a poor workman whose toolbox contains only a hammer (no matter how big it is!), and it is a poor programmer (or software development organization) whose development toolkit contains only one programming language. Our toolboxes should contain both Python and Java, so that in any given situation we have the option of choosing the best tool for the job. So our claim is not that Python is the only programming language that you’ll ever need — only that the number of jobs for which Python is the best tool is much larger than is generally recognized..There are three main language characteristics that make programmers more productive with Python than with Java..In Java, all variable names (along with their types) must be explicitly declared. Attempting to assign an object of the wrong type to a variable name triggers a type exception.That’s what it means to say that Java is a . language..Java container objects (e.g. . and .) hold objects of the generic type ., but cannot hold primitives such as .. To store an int in a Vector, you must first convert the int to an .. When you retrieve an object from a container, it doesn’t remember its type, and must be explicitly cast to the desired type..In Python, you never declare anything. An assignment statement binds a name to an object, and the object can be of any type. If a name is assigned to an object of one type, it may later be assigned to an object of a different type. That’s what it means to say that Python is a . language..Python container objects (e.g. lists and dictionaries) can hold objects of any type, including numbers and lists. When you retrieve an object from a container, it remembers its type, so no casting is required..For more information on static vs. dynamic typing, see .“abounding in words; using or containing more words than are necessary”.“expressing much in a few words. Implies clean-cut brevity, attained by excision of the superfluous”.In ., Eric S. Raymond gives the following definition for “compact”:.Compact adj. Of a design, describes the valuable property that it can all be apprehended at once in one’s head. This generally means the thing created from the design can be used with greater facility and fewer errors than an equivalent tool that is not compact..The classic “Hello, world!” program illustrates the relative verbosity of Java..In the following example, we initialize an integer to zero, then convert it to a string, then check to see if it is empty. Note the data declaration (highlighted), which is necessary in Java but not in Python. Notice also how verbose Java is, even in an operation as basic as comparing two strings for equality..Your application has 15 classes. (More precisely, it has 15 top-level public classes.).In your application, method A calls B calls C calls D calls E calls F. You discover that F must throw  exception SpecialException, and it must be caught by A..The reason for this is that Java, virtually alone among object-oriented programming languages, uses . — exceptions that must be caught or thrown by every method in which they  might appear, or the code will fail to compile. Recently (as of June 2003) there seems to be an increasing amount of unhappiness with Java’s use of checked exceptions. See Bruce Eckel’s . and Ron Waldhoff’s ...As ., the Technical Editor of the O’Reilly Network, .:.I like the idea of checked exceptions in some situations, but forcing every method to deal with (catching or throwing) all exceptions that its child calls or may call can be tedious. I’d rather be able to ignore an exception and let it propagate upwards. Sometimes, I’d rather not worry about  exceptions at all..Your application has an . class. When an instance of Employee is created, the constructor may be passed one, two, or three arguments..If you are programming in Java, this means that you write three constructors, with three different signatures. If you are programming in Python, you write only a single constructor, with default values for the optional arguments..In Python, a class has only one constructor. .The constructor method is simply another method of the class, but one that has a special name: .In . Eric S. Raymond notes that:.Python … is compact — you can hold its entire feature set (and at least a concept index of its libraries) in your head..In . Bruce Eckel notes that Java is not compact..I can remember many Python idioms because they’re simpler. That’s one more reason I program faster [in Python]. I still have to look up how to open a file every time I do it in Java. In fact, most things in Java require me to look something up..Java’s string-handling capabilities are surprisingly weak. (But they have improved considerably with the addition of the . method to the String class in Java 1.4.).Code to add an . to a ., and then retrieve it..Prior to Java 1.5, a new . object had to be created and initialized from the . before it could be added to a Vector. In order to retrieve the value, the member of the Vector had to be cast back to an ., and then converted back to an ...This clumsiness was eliminated in Java 1.5 with the introduction of . (which allows you to “type” a container object) and . (which automates conversion between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes). With generics, it is possible to code:.which reads as:.Verbosity is not just a matter of increasing the number of characters that must be typed — it is  also a matter of increasing the number of places where mistakes can be made. The Java code on the left has 5  control characters: . where the corresponding Python code has only one control character, the colon. (Or two, if you count indentation. See below.).Omitting or duplicating such characters is easy to do accidentally, and constitutes a severe error in  the code. In my personal estimate, I spend 5 times as much time fixing such errors in Java as I do in Python.  It really cuts into your productivity — and your creative energy — when you spend that much of  your time just trying to satisfy the compiler..Technically, Python has another control character that Java does not — indentation. But the  requirement for correct indentation is the same in Java as it is in Python, because in both languages correct  indentation is a practical requirement for human-readable code. The Python interpreter automatically enforces  correct indentation, whereas the Java compiler does not. With Java, you need an add-on product such as the . code formatter to provide automated.\nenforcement of indentation standards..Thanks to Skip Montanaro, Chris Lawrence, Donald McCarthy, Bengt Richter, and Christian Pohlmann for  helpful feedback on earlier versions of this page..I have a couple of comments:.– Regarding the constructor example (3 constructors for an Employee). That’s not relevant anymore, now that Java has support for varargs..– It is also a bit unfair to compare “==” with “equals”. “==” means something different in Java. It is a test for an actual equality, and not two strings that share the same contents..In Python, “is” stands for identity and “==” for equality..This article is full of trivial mistake..-statically typed.this works.\n        Object a = new int[3];.\nand this too with autoboxing.\n        int c = 0;.\n        Object b = c;.\nand don’t forget generics..-verbose.\nin a world where developer do not can/want document their code,.\n  verbose code is the only help..-not compact.\nExist, genirics, autoboxing, reflection, inline declaratio, anonymous or not inner class,.\n  ecc.. to write compact “unreadable”  code..-Example public class HelloWorld.java is verbose but document that write a string to stdout..look at  print “Hello, world!” .where write? write a LF at the end? .-Example int myCounter = 0;ecc...if you like compact and unreadable try.int myCounter;.\nif (“0”.equals(“” + (myCounter = 0))).Example 15 classes..use Inner Class, you could write an entire webserver in one class,.\n   but you could use only the main method and write procedural.. .-Example exception.Use RuntimeException, or a mix of Checked and Runtime.throw new RuntimeException(new Exception(…)).personally i hate checked, but is only my attitude.. .-Example employee class.in Java three costructor?.Pass a map to costruct very very dirty unreadable but works.. .Dont forget that every costructor could have a different scope.. in phyton?.-Example IO file.myFile = open(argFilename) .documentation? is buffered? kind of stream? text file reader? binary?.libraries are very usefull too, es IOUtils for jakarta apache commons, lookat IOUtils.readLines.-Example trim.as before, StringUtils.-Example Vector.with Java collections is very different from array.there are many outofthebox implementation, sorted, unorderd, from synchronized list (vector) to Stack.\nbut there are many other in libraries es Bags (special kind of set) as FastArrayList, look in org.apache.commons.collections.-Example formatter.Come on guy, there are so many IDE, command line tool, addon to versioning system that format code,.\n  for every language..This comment, on the contrary, is just one *big* mistake..You are correct...\nJAVA is more understandable for the beginners..\nin python you have to care about indentation but in java it does not matter until u have brackets..You will use indentation anyway. It is just good practice..You are simply proving that less verbose in java is really really bad and complicated !!!.\nYour points have nothing to do with python. .About IO differences in python, you’re describing it as if every day, the behaviour of the funcitions is defined by some arbitrary evil function. Like one day it will add newline, and the day after it won’t -_-.Impressive! Never thought one has to type so much boilerplate in Java. IMO, all those IDEs are the cure of this very issue which is artificial..I’ve been writing a lot of Python code recently, getting away with gedit only. I can sketch a piece of code on a piece of paper at lunch (I don’t like smartphones). Would that be possible in Java?.Seems like using IDEs with auto-completion, utility libraries, and other stuff in Java cures the issues that could have been avoided. It’s like buying a Porsche Cayen in a city like Buenos Aires, San Paulo or Moscow: most your driving time you’ll be in traffic jams, but there are things to make sitting in the car comfortable (TV, audio, maybe bar, maybe even a toilet xD)..^ Exactly! A good IDE (in my experience Eclipse works best) can cure most, if not all of the above “shortcomings” of the Java syntax.If you actullay knew Java then this article actually would make sense. Now it’s more fooling rookies..Experienced programmers would never fall for these bad examples… Comaring python to Java is like comparing a bicyle to a car. Sure, it’s easier to learn to ride and you don’t need to struggle with the licencse, but as soon as you want to go more than 10 miles (“write an enterprise application”), the only choice of the two is the car..Try that in London, You can easilly go 15 miles in an hour on a bike. In a car it takes two and you have to park the thing..You clearly have not counted in bicycle addicted like me… With which I do not want to state that I would not consider to stretch the application of Phyton a bit to see how far it will go. Or are you suggesting the car being the metaphor for Phyton? 😉 Of course in this case the metaphor is a bit off too as we are using Phyton (Django front end) and Java (with rest interfaces) in the same project. 😉.No matter if you like the examples or not, python is used in large applications, like Dropbox client and all server applications..Your argument about compact / not compact is not really valid. Note that your quote from Eric S. Raymond talks about *design*, and not about any specific programming language. How you design the structure of an application is largely independent of the programming language you use. And the box “not compact” in the Java column is empty, you’re not even presenting an argument why “Java is not compact”..I do agree that Java is more verbose than other languages such as Python, but a Hello World program is not a realistic example to demonstrate this..Your second example, converting an int to a string and looking if the string contains “0”, is strange and is not the way you should normally write programs. And note that in Java you can leave off the braces, so the example with the for-loop in Java can be written in two lines (or even one line), just like the Python version..There’s a good reason why in Java you would want to save each public top-level class in its own file. This makes it easy to find the file in which a class is defined..The example about the exceptions is only true if SpecialException is a checked exception. If you make SpecialException an unchecked exception, you do not need to change the method signatures of B, C, D, E and F. Your example makes it seem as if there are only checked exceptions in Java, which is not true..So, this is not really a great comparison between Java and Python..Some notes:.\nStatic vs dynamic typing:.\nstatic type checking may not help much with getting less errors but it helps immensely to get better tools. Show me an IDE that can do the same Eclipse can do for Java like.\n– show all callers of a method / uses of a variable/field project-wide.\n– change a class/method signature including all callers in a few clicks.\n– context assists and hyperlinks everywhere.\nI find bigger refactorings in dynamically typed language much harder because you often have to resort to simple text search/replace..Multiple classes in one file:.\nThis is nice for small scripts but bad for bigger projects… for best readability you want all your units (metohds, classes, files) to be as short as possible..Java is verbose / parantheses, etc:.\nyeah, they are often superflouos. But modern IDEs mostly solve this problem with their content-assist and templates..the rest:.\nFor nearly everything that is complicated in Java (and all other things, too) there are good (as in enterprise-ready, properly documented (thanks@Sun for Javadoc), free) libraries. And you can assume that a JRE is already present on most PCs and smartphones and that, as long as you don’t attempt any low level things, your code will run 100%. For python, you have it on most unixes by default… that’s it..\nJython helps a bit, but its incomplete and far behind C-Python..I don’t say that Java is flawless, but I think that it currently is the best cross-OS development platform for big projects..Some points to add as I find this article very misleading, .1- Java is pure Object Oriented and you MUST declare all objects, Python supports other programming paradigms so you don’t need to declare all variables…that’s also a Fortran problem and turn codes into “black boxes”. For your example is ok….but if you have thousands of variables you have to guess each???.2- PythonDoc is an implementation of JavaDoc for Python…(yes, verbose helps a lot and Python copied that from Java!!!!) see how many men-hour can be saved if a good documentation is generated and attached. .3- Try to run programs that require tons of memory with undeclared variables. The reason Java declares all of them is ’cause it does allow memory allocation (virtual machine) and the Garbage Collector (never mentioned) can run efficiently..4- Messiness is mostly due to the programmer not the language. Besides IDEs (Eclipse) already fix that problem. .5- Try to run codes in parallel (MPI) libraries to see who wins..import multiprocessing.there is a good reason for declaring variables. suppose that you have been working with the variable “foo” for a while. Later, you want to reassign it, but you make a typo, instead of:.\nfoo=7.\nyou type:.\nfooo=7.in a language that requires variables to be declared, this would generate a compile-time error. in a language that doesn’t, the program would generate a new variable “fooo” and carry right along..W00t? This is the right behaviour. When you mistype it, you got fooo as a new variable. It’s you own fault, not the language’s!.oh and btw. When you use a variable, which is not declared in Python, it will raise a NameError..True. The interpreter will not prevent you to make programming errors..\nJava is mostly a newbie language that overprotects the bad programmers from themselves..You’re joking, right?.Since everyone above is saying that Eclipse saves Java programmers from a lot of these problems, I’ll use the same defense for python. Python has libraries like pyLint and pyChecker that IDEs can use. For instance, in the example above, if you typed fooo=7 the IDE (such as Eric5)  would periodically check the code in real time and then flag that line with a warning like “Variable initialized but never used”. Do something like “x = fooo + 3” and it’ll warn you with “Variable used but never initialized”, etc..The author claims that the increased productivity of python is due to its dynamic typing, but it seems to me that the overhead of having to declare the type of a variable is actually pretty small. And that small overhead brings many advantages, e.g. the ability of IDEs to autocomplete function names, show helpful tooltips, etc..Java is verbose, yes, but most of that is not related to static typing. It’s more for other reasons, e.g the unwillingness of the language designers to allow operator overloading; the horrible decision to use checked exceptions; no delegates; no multiple class definitions in a file; the unwillingless to “clutter” up the standard library with useful functionality that can be achieved in other, albeit more verbose, ways; the legacy from C syntax. And so on..If you want to see a statically typed modern language done (mostly) right, check out C#. Sure it’s a product of Microsoft, but it’s one of the most nicely designed languages out there. Where Java prefers “elegance” and verbosity, C# is designed with practical programming constructs in mind. And since version 3.0, it does type inference as well..Don’t get me wrong, I still like Python, but for production quality large programs, I think C# is just as productive, runs faster, and is far less likely to contain stupid runtime errors caused by typos..Cheers,.Sy.Java wins because of refactoring and consistency..\nBefore super smart ide’s like Eclipse, Netbeans, and Intellij I would say Python was a better programming environment then Java..But these new ide’s have changed the game completely. Instead of refactoring at the start of a new development cycle I refactor all the time. Instead of having UML charts and CRC cards and all that good OO planning crap you now (because of refactoring) can just write the code. I find proper language very important in expressing the domain you are working with that I care very much about the names of objects..With python I would have to plan this in advance because it is a pain in the butt to refactor in dynamic languages..Python is also not very consistent compared to Java. People can’t decide on consistent naming of methods and there are few odd things (like print with out parens)..\nBTW have you noticed Python 3 looks more and more like Java..“Python is also not very consistent compared to Java”.\nNo, it’s different form the beginning. Try to import your habits rom a language to another, the result will never be good. To understand the power of the Python language, you *must* play the game and conform yourself to the discipline..\nMoreover, why would I need a complex and heavy IDE since simple Gedit/Geany do the work ?.\nFinally, you can refactor in any language you want. it does not depend on the syntax or whatever, but on your skills to avoid redundancy in your code..Are you seriously suggesting that you would write an enterprise application in Gedit?.I do it in vim.vim… I use vi.vi… I use emacs.Since everyone is bashing python, I would like to give my point of view from someone who has programmed in java and in python, and that likes python more than java..For the ones that say that super IDE’s solve the problems of java, I would like to say that I have used both Oracle JDeveloper, Eclipse and Sun Netbeans. And from JDeveloper I have to say that it lacks features from the other two, for Eclipse that I need to get an extra 1Gb of RAM in order to run it together with my other applications (Try to configure Eclipse, to show how many memory it is “eating” in order, to check what I say), and them we have Netbeans that is the nicest IDE for java, but the fact that it isn’t easily expandable like eclipse with plug-ins means that you will have to download another version if you happen to suddenly develop something that requires J2ME instead of J2EE that you normally use. But all of these IDE’s require memory and some experience time in order to be used efficiently, so using a super IDE to correct java problems it’s not a way to solve things, at least not the way that I would use..Now from the python side, it’s true that you don’t have a super IDE, but you don’t need one in order to use python… All you need to use python is the own interpreter, to indent your code and a basic idea of what you want to do. And a simple text editor, like notepad to type your code if you would like to persist it… It’s sure that python hasn’t a lot of libraries and tools as java has. But the ones that it has, are enough..I can write my python programs in Microsofts note pad, even on iPod – heck on the back of a paper napkin if I want to… 98% of the time they’ll run first time with no exeptions!.\nby the time you’ve finished cleaning bugs i.e: “crap that should be an int, hmmm… and the bracket”, I’ll be watching old episodes of baywatch, having already delivered the software to the client..\nTo top it all of I can (thanks to jython) write python for your beloved Java VM..“Jython, lest you do not know of it, is the most compelling weapon the Java platform has for its survival into the 21st century” – SeanMcGrath.—————-.\nprint(“boo ya”)#the simplicity….\n—————-.But alas, speed/memory… crap JAVA wins….\nMobile platforms… JAVA wins..\nPopularity… sigh JAVA wins…again. thanks to Universty brain washing….\nLibraries… hmmm… JAVA, just… really, just….But who really wins?… the programmer who can code in both languages proficiently, and who knows which to use and when..\n… and who knows resisting the tide of change is futile….\n———-.\nevil_laugh = “mwa” + “ha “*100.\nprint(evil_laugh)#i havent even tested this code yet i know it just works :-). Python 3.1.\n———.Sorry. But your just showing that Python is normally shorter than Java, which has nothing to do with typing..Thinking about how I would write your examples in a statically typed language of my choice makes your python code look pretty verbose..You’re totally missing the point..The last point about code comments is laughable – “In my personal estimate, I spend 5 times as much time fixing such errors in Java as I do in Python”. Here is a secret – next time try using a decent IDE 🙂.Overall agree, that py is very terse, readable and to the point – but it still lacks the ability to parallel process and is way too slow when compared to Java..¿lacks the ability to parallel processing?.\nCheck this out.* With python you have direct access to the pthread (posix) library: thread.\n* A higher level threading interface easier to work with than thread: threading.\n* Jet another library for trivially parallel loops: multiprocessing.For more info check the documentation.\n.For those on cluster computing, you also have MPI:.\n.If you are serious about bottlenecks, you can bind C/C++ code as a python module..Have a nice day.If you are serious about bottlenecks, you can bind C/C++ code as a python module..So what you’re saying is that one of the advantages Python has is that you can rewrite your stuff in C or C++ if you’re “serious” about performance bottlenecks.  Hahaha that’s priceless..Have a nice day!.You can also extend Python with D: . but i think Cython is easiest: .And C++ isn’t that hard with ShedSkin: .Or just use PyPy: .it is foolish to ignore the importance of a compiler’s help. so python would be a disaster for a new large project, BUT today 99% chance is you build a small part of a big system, so python may be more productive and flexible..I don’t think dynamic typing makes more productive:.– if you don’t declare the variable type, then your IDE cannot know what it is and cannot save you a tremendous lot of keystrokes with features like auto-completion. .– if you don’t declare the variable type, then there is no compile time (or even pre compile time) check possible to point out typos which will lead in errors at runtime. .– if you don’t declare the variable type, then people using your methods won’t know what they should pass to it by simply reading the method signature. .– if you don’t declare the variable type, then your code will be less easier to understand and to maintain..@Anonymous (#17) – You seem to assume that Python is just as overly complex as Java, but this is not the case. Python is quite simple to read and it therefore reduces the amount of errors that are made in the first place so you do not need to declare errors before compilation (and btw, Python checks the files syntax on load). Also, Python functions and methods can have a docstring which can explain exactly what type of data to pass to it and again, without the extra complexity of Java, it is easy to figure out. And your last comment is simply a myth. I have absolutely no problem reading or maintaining Python code which has even a small amount of documentation. Instead, type declarations just make the code more complex than is needed and restricts flexibility..As far as IDE auto-complete for certain types, it is not needed as the small number of methods used to interface with Python objects can be built-in and it can still save you many keystrokes..Definitely not agreed with your article. Java is far more better for many reasons. I grant you that put down some lines in a bare notepad and compile them in Java is error prone, longer and surely boring (you have probably to search for imports, write long names, etc…) but with all the existent environmnents around JAVA and for Java, you don’t have any problem. All is fast, reliable, fit for big and scalable projects, and you can open files in any editor without screwing all with a wrong Tab option set (The Python biggest deficency for me is to be tied with the way you write and so the editor you are using)..\nI programmed in python but the performance is also poor. You can consider python for little projects, and be aware of some inheritance differences with java..\nAlso, if you want to use some third party library , you have to hope that the maintainer were careful about documentation sync with the code, thing that I rarely found in python external libs..As in php (that is currently better than python as a web language), i’m a fan of the static type instead of dynamic. This eliminates the principal cause of errors in compiling and (worse) running sessions. In a lot of coded lines, it’s difficult to see an error like :.\nvariable=1;.\n….\nprint varialbe;.python does not warn me (because of dinamic typing the ‘varialbe’ is initialized to null)..Anyway i think that python could become a good language in the near future if it’ll be surrounded by many support and enterprise structures that’ll permit to use it as a strong and solid base for enterprise applications. And in any case it will be good surely for fast prototyping..So your argument is both Java and Python suck without a decent editor. Good thing that Python is so terse, then. As for your example, it doesn’t work as you described it:.C:\\Python32>python.\nPython 3.2 (r32:88445, Feb 20 2011, 21:29:02) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32.\nType “help”, “copyright”, “credits” or “license” for more information..\n>>> variabler.\nTraceback (most recent call last):.\n  File “”, line 1, in.\nNameError: name ‘variabler’ is not defined.\n>>> variable = 1.\n>>> print varialbe.\n  File “”, line 1.\n    print varialbe.\n                 ^.\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax.\n>>> print(varialbe).\nTraceback (most recent call last):.\n  File “”, line 1, in.\nNameError: name ‘varialbe’ is not defined.\n>>>.i m a student and using java and found it too useful for big projects.i used c and c++ already  and now unfortunately learning python :(and found it too difficult bcoz sometimes its too difficult to use such a simple syntax and i often got stuck in it :(((((((((.That’s rather vague. Could you be more specific about your problem? In Java I spend more time figuring out the frameworks than actually solving business problems..If you cannot write proper english, you will have a lot more difficult writing in a formal language like python or java..I have used Java for over 12 years now, and I agree that Java has become cumbersome in some areas, which is why open minded Java developers are looking elsewhere. However, definitely not for the above reasons. Most of them are either syntactic sugar variations of the same thing, or otherwise subjective opinions..When one looks objectively at the above examples, they definitely do not demonstrate the 5 to 10-fold speed optimisations claimed in the article. In most examples its simply a question of syntactic sugar (e.g. Java requires { } to surround a block of code while Python does it with indentations… no big deal or optimisation, especially considering that most IDEs do these automatically, so if you’re a manager thinking that this will make your developers faster, it won’t.).In most cases its just a question that Java requires some structure and not things floating around. The latter is available in Python simply because its a scripting language. .If one considers Example 1, on its own yes Java requires a class to put your stuff in so its 2 extra lines. But realistically no minimally useful script or class will be that simple. So its just a question of wrapping things in a structured way in Java. .== Static vs Dynamic ==.The question of static typing versus dynamic typing is a purely a question of opinion and the application domain you’re developing..\nOne downside to dynamic typing is that larger enterprise applications become more difficult to refactor. In static typing, changing a couple of classes will automatically break the compilation and you’ll immediately know what else you need to fix in order to have the program working again.With most modern IDEs this is also facilitated by refactoring tools which tell you immediately what will be impacted before the change and also automate the changes..Another problem with dynamic typing is that its more difficult for IDEs to auto-complete fields and methods if the type cannot be disambiguously deduced. .== Multiple classes in one file ==.One can’t seriously state that this is an advantage. Java enforces you to do it not because the Java guys couldn’t do it, its because it is good practice to do so. If you don’t do this the code becomes unmaintainable as soon as it exceeds the 15 classes mark. You want to change the Employee class in java, you just have to open Employee.java, you need to do it in Python… good luck searching through the files..I also use PHP and even though PHP carries the same ‘advantages’ from Python (it is both dynamically typed and allows multiple classes in one file) I still put my classes in separate files which carry the same name. Any serious work I’ve seen also adopts the same approach..Again, if you’re a manager, this will slow your developers due to decreased maintainability not make them faster, so dont even consider it. If you do go for Python, it still makes sense to have classes in one place..== Compactness and Readability ==.I tend to disagree with most statements in the examples..\nJava adopts a very simple convention, that constructors have the same name of the class. Its logical, intuitive and makes perfect sense..\nWhy should a class have a method with the same name? It only makes sense to be the constuctor..Instead in Pyton you have to use a cryptic method called __init__.\nApart from the varargs issue, which is in fact supported (maybe not as cleanly) in Java, constructors in Java are far more intuitive..You might also have noticed the ‘self’ argument in the constructor. So essentially, the class’s constructor also needs to be polluted with this parameter because there is no inherent ‘this’ that can be used within the class. Java supports this much more cleanly with a supplied ‘this’ keyword. Its also consistent because all developers use that, while Python all developers do what they want, some use ‘self’, some use ‘this’, some use ‘myself’…. confusion welcome..With regards to using indentations instead of curly brackets. Again this is not an advantage at all. It just invites confusion in. Most IDEs put the closing curly automatically so its not something that will contribute to slower development. On the other hand it clearly delineates code blocks..\nUsing indentations just invites problems with different text editors. The curly also has the advantage that most IDEs highlight the opening curly when you select hover over the closing curly (even though if you adapt the allman-style coding this won’t be needed anyway)..———.I am not saying that all is rosy on the Java side. I am just saying that these examples are the perfectly wrong reasons to consider..Some of the problems of Java are:.1. JAR hell. .The way libraries are managed in Java were elegant in the early 2000s where you would have a handful of Jar files and you would know what each was doing. Nowadays, there are so many of them that you would need to include in an application that it becomes a nightmare to manage, especially due to interdependencies between them and conflicting versions. .Maven came along which kind of solves this problem, but its still there, just managed a bit more intelligently. .2. Desktop performance.The performance of Java on the desktop for some reason never got anywhere near native or .Net applications. You immediately know that you have a Java desktop application because its slow to start up, hangs intermittently (due to garbage collection) and has a lousy UI..\nIn fact the only ‘successful’ desktop apps written in Java are in fact Java IDEs..This is in fact a true source of slowness. Java developers typically waste 20% of their time playing around getting their environment to work. Starting up the IDE takes minutes. Then it starts hanging after an hour or so of developing. You can throw more computing power at it obviously, but we’ve been throwing more computing power at it for the last 10 years with newer PCs, more memory and faster CPUs, and the problem is still there..3. Web Applications.Developing a web application in Java is in fact very complex.You have to understand the whole framework of web application servers, servlet containers, application contexts, and all just to even start doing a simple web application. When you’ve done that you realise that what you know is not really enough to make a maintainable reasonably sized application, so you have to learn other technologies such as Spring, Spring MVC, or JSF. After you’ve done that you realise you also want to hit the database, and you have to learn JDBC and JPA. .By that time, a developer in another more web-oriented language would have already completed the project, got the pat on the back and moved on to another one..The end result in Java is very neat but the learning curve is very steep. You can easily go wrong somewhere and the moment you have a problem the tools are less than helpful. The only advantage of going for Java for web apps is when you have a large application which requires thought, discipline and good object oriented design, maybe with some scalability needs and requirements for message queuing (JMS etc.) or integration with more Java friendly components..Developing web services is also similarly complex. Conflicts between the bundled JAX-WS and any updated version often drive Java developers crazy and is a major cause of suicides..So, yes this is a true source of slowness of Java. .Bottom line is that most of the slowness of Java is not with the language itself, which is just C-style like 70% of the other languages (C, C++, C#, Javascript, PHP…). Its because expectations in certain areas have outgrown its original design and other more domain-specific languages provide a more agile framework..Disclaimer: I’m not a proper programmer, I’m a mathematician looking for unbiased advice..I like python, don’t know Java. I find it highly productive. I don’t get the arguments that it’s not suitable for large scale applications because it doesn’t enforce “discipline” or “good object oriented design”. I don’t want the language to enforce anything, but maybe it helps if your coworkers write sloppy code..However, it seems like Python is used more by the academic community (most notably the academics without a CS background, such as myself), whereas Java is used more for large enterprises, can someone enlighten me as to why this is the case? I’m currently in the process of writing a prototype for a  large data retrieval and analysis framework. I get results quickly in Python (hence why I use it for prototyping) but I’m worried that I might have to rewrite everything in a non-scripting language later on. Should I be worried? The plan is to get investment capital so we can employ some “proper” programmers who knows these things!.Basically, is this article as biased towards Python as it appears to be from all the comments?.“…whereas Java is used more for large enterprises, can someone enlighten me as to why this is the case…”.There are perfectly valid reasons for using Java on enterprise projects (strong server infrastructure, frameworks, portability, etc), but there are also other reasons why Java is often used for enterprise projects, even where it is not necessarily the best choice, especially when large outsourcing consultancies are involved:.1. Universities teach Java, so CS grads know it (a bit…) => cheap grunt programmers easily available..\n2. Indian universities turn out lots of Java-enabled CS grads => even cheaper grunt programmers available offshore..\n3. Java “culture” encourages the idea that you can do everything in Java => no need to teach your grunt programmers about anything else, even if it would be useful to do so..\n4. Java EE is very complex and becomes ever more complex in line with Moore’s Law i.e. complexity doubles every few years.  Complexity => costs => profits for consultancies..\n5. Efforts to combat that complexity e.g. Spring have themselves now become almost as complex as the “problem” they were intended to solve => complexity generates complexity..\n6. Once you’ve invested in a complex Java EE system, you’re pretty much trapped in Java-land => more profits for long-term support agreements etc..“… Java is used more for large enterprises, can someone enlighten me as to why this is the case…”.I’d like to add to Matt’s last point, which I’ll rephrase like this:  “For any given programming language J, once you’ve got a major investment in J, you’re pretty much trapped in J land.”  .Suppose you are an enterprise IT manager.  Your staff know programming language J.  You’ve developed a number of large systems in J; you’ve created build, test, and deploy procedures and tools for programs written in J; you and your staff are comfortable with J and have mastered the art of system development in J..Now suppose that you have some new kind of programming task to perform.  The task can be done using J (albeit it will take a while, and the result will be not very elegant) or it can be done using using some other programming language P, where the task can be done in P much more easily and elegantly. .The problem is that you already know J — there is no learning curve to climb with J — but you’d have to expend some time and effort to learn P.   And you know that there will be other tasks down the road that might be best done in some other language P2, and some other tasks for which P3 is the best tool, and then P4, and P5, and so on.  And you know that that way lies madness.  If you go down that path, you’ll soon have to maintain systems written in a dozen languages, and eventually you’ll find yourself in a situation where some programmer leaves; he wrote some system in programming language P9; but he was the only one who knew P9; now he’s gone and none of your staff can maintain the system. .So you decide to standardize on J, where J is some general-purpose widely-used language that has a lot of add-on packages and frameworks that allow you to do just about anything in J.  You make the decision: “From now on, we do EVERYTHING in J.”  .The managers of many (most?) enterprise shops are in this situation, and they choose to standardize on Java because they need to control costs, and to control the number of programming languages that they are using.   This decision is partly a matter of economics (the need to control costs), and partly a matter of management (the need to manage the number of languages used in your shop).  These are good reasons, and the basic ideas behind the decision are undeniably good ones..So that is my take on why “Java is used more for large enterprises.”  Now: here is my take on why that is a bad idea..The problem is that — although the basic reasons motivating the decision are good ones — the idea that ONE size fits all is simply too restrictive. A tool box that contains only one tool is simply not enough. If you confine yourself to just ONE language, you will find that there are cases that are simply too much of a stretch for that language.  Personally, I think that every shop needs to standardize on at least *two* general-purpose languages — one “system” language for major systems where performance is the highest priority, and one scripting language where ease-of-use, flexibility, and speed of development are the highest priority.  .Personally, I think a combination of Java and Python is a good choice. And I believe that a management decision that “From now on, we do EVERYTHING in Java,” is a big mistake..But that was the situation that I was in when I originally wrote this article.  Our shop at the time used a systems language and a scripting language— Java and Perl.  We had found through experience that the Perl was unmaintainable. And we had decided to migrate our Perl applications to something else.  I thought that Python would be an excellent replacement for Perl.  .But the division chief felt that we should standardize on a SINGLE language — *only* on Java — and that we should migrate all of our Perl apps to Java.  In my opinion, this would have been a very bad (actually, a ridiculous) decision, so I wrote this post to explain (in part) why I thought that . Python is a better choice than Java..So that’s all I have to say on that subj… What?  Oh, you want to know the end of the story?  Well, OK….There was a management turn-over.  The new division chief had a completely different “let a thousand flowers bloom” philosophy.  It was like a breath of fresh air.  Soon the group — in addition to its older systems in Java and Perl — had new systems written in Python and Ruby.  I eventually developed a large application (30,000+ lines) in Java, and a testing framework for the application (the first such framework in our group) written in Python.  .That was the upside.  The downside is that because the group never decided to standardize on a scripting language (Perl, Python, Ruby, whatever), it now faces the problem that I mentioned earlier.  I was the only one in the group that used Python.  When I left the group, they were left with a large, sophisticated test harness written in Python… but without anyone who knows Python to maintain it..>When I left the group, they were left with a large, sophisticated test harness written in Python… but without anyone who knows Python to maintain it..Yeah, now someone will have to spend up to *one* entire day to read the one page you need to read to understand the Python language 🙂.As the author of this post, I’d like to talk a little bit about why (I think) there are so many allegations (most of them, in fact, attached to the .) that the post is biased, and about whether or not I agree with those allegations.  I’m going to paint with a broad brush here..I think that the first reason for the charge of bias is that .  In fact, many readers completely missed the point that I was trying to make.  .If you read the post carefully, you will see that I make no claims that Java is a better programming language than Python, or that you don’t need Java because Python is the only programming language that you will ever need, or  that you can do all of your programming in Python, or that Python is superior to Java in any way other than productivity.  I make no claim that I’m offering a comprehensive, technical feature comparison of the two languages.  In fact, the post contains several statements . that I’m making any such claims..But I think that many Java programmers quickly skimmed the post and responded as if I’d simply grunted “PYTHON! GOOD!  JAVA! BAD!”  .Naturally, their reactions were negative and, in many cases, angry.  If you read the comments, you can see that some of the commentators are almost incoherent with rage.  .I want to note, however, there were a few Java programmers who read the post more carefully, and responded with helpful information and calm, reasonable, comments.  It was a pleasure and a learning experience to read those comments, and (amazing as it may seem) I agree with many of them.  .The second reason is that .   After reading the post, I think that most Python programmers simply shrugged — “Yeah. So what.  I know that.  Nothing new here.” — and moved on.  In contrast, many Java programmers read the post as an ignorant yet vicious attack on their favorite technology (see reason number one, above).  Naturally, many of them responded, and responded with vigorous dissent..So I think the charges of bias can be accounted for by the fact that most comments are from Java programmers, many or most of those Java programmers are angry, and many of the angry Java programmers did not read the article carefully or objectively.  I don’t think the post was biased, but I think that many readers read it as making more sweeping claims about Python and Java than I was actually making.  (Probably, I should have worded the post differently, although I’m not sure how much difference that might have made.  For what I would do differently if I were writing the post today, May 2012, see below.) .Let me talk a bit about the kinds of comments on the post.  There were many kinds of comments, but a few (sometimes overlapping) categories stand out..The first category includes comments citing (a) the superiority of Java IDEs (over simple text processors or Python IDEs), and/or (b) the superiority of Java’s declarative static typing over Python’s dynamic typing.   Some of these comments asserted that — “Yes, Java is more verbose than Python.  But Java IDEs are so good that they make up for the difference, and in effect allow a Java programmer to be just as productive as a Python programmer (as measured by function points per keystroke).”.Some of these comments asserted simply that you cannot build large (enterprise-scale) applications in a dynamically-typed language.  Some of these comments asserted that — “The declarative statically-typed nature of Java allows Java IDEs to be much more powerful and useful than simple text editors or Python IDEs; this makes Java programmers more effective when developing — and especially when refactoring — large code bases.”  .A second category asserted that I was comparing apples and oranges.  Python may be OK for small systems, but for large systems (a) Java’s static typing, (b) Java’s superior performance, and (c) the superior powers of Java IDEs make Java the only rational choice.  A nice example of this type of comment came from Daniel:.Comparing Python to Java is like comparing a bicyle to a car. Sure, it’s easier to learn to ride and you don’t need to struggle with the license, but as soon as you want to go more than 10 miles (“write an enterprise application”), the only choice of the two is the car..A third category of comments focused on features of Java.  Such comments typically included assertions like — You don’t really know Java; your example of Java feature F was wrong; the latest version of Java has a new feature F which invalidates one of your points; or you should have mentioned the following Java features (followed in some cases by quite a long list of features).  In this category, many comments began with words to the effect that either (a) “You’re wrong.  Java is by far the best language because Java …[list of Java features]” or (b) “I agree.  Python is by far the best programming language.  I can’t stand Java because Java …[list of Java features]”..I’m not really sympathetic to the third category of comments, because they completely miss my point.  I don’t think that there is any “best” programming language.  As I wrote in the introduction to the post:.\nOur toolboxes should contain both Python and Java, so that in any given situation we have the option of choosing the best tool for the job. So our claim is not that Python is the only programming language that you’ll ever need — only that the number of jobs for which Python is the best tool is much larger than is generally recognized.\n.I’m much more sympathetic to the first two categories of comment.  The comments citing the superiority of Java IDEs were appropriate a few years ago, although they now seem less compelling with the release of the JetBrains . Python IDE.  But I think that I would agree that the statically-typed nature of Java allows Java IDEs to be much more powerful than Python IDEs, and this helps Java programmers immensely as they develop and refactor large code bases..The downside, of course, is that it is virtually impossible to develop a Java program outside of an IDE.  Java programmers are virtually chained to their IDEs (and their specific IDE — Eclipse, NetBeans, whatever) in a way that Python programmers are not.  Technically, this may not be a . issue, but for some developers it is definitely a personal taste issue..In conclusion — If I was writing the post today, I would be less inclined simply to talk about the “productivity” of Python programmers compared to Java programmers.  There are many dimensions for measuring productivity, and many kinds of applications, and a language feature that enhances programmer productivity for one type of application might actually impair programmer productivity for another type of application.  .If I was writing the post today, I think that instead of talking about “productivity” I would instead talk about matching tools and tasks. Any large organization is in the business of building many kinds of software applications.  I would emphasize that for building some types of applications, a systems language such as Java is the best tool; and for building other types of applications, a dynamically-typed language such as Python (or Ruby) is the best choice..thanks for the clarification. Java is now vindicated 🙂.There is a Linux distribution written in Python: Pardus. That proves you can do big projects in Python..Come on man, an open source linux distro will have 100’s if not 1000’s of developers working on it. .————–.I’ve read most of the comments here and I’ve used both Java and Python. Leaving aside the comparisons of the two languages I agree mostly with what JBX and what Steve Ferg had to say in the end. .I think as programmers and software “houses” we shouldn’t be comparing languages, each language has a specific purpose because of their differences. .A heavy language like Java, C, .NET and objective C is a good weapon in your arsenal for systems programming (Java and C would be the clear winner since .NET and objective-C are platform dependant). A scripting language like ruby, python, hell even PHP is a good weapon for web development and rapid prototyping. A lightweight powerful language like Ada is great for embedded programming and for use in safety critical situations where program proof of correctness is more important than lack of bugs (which beats strongly typed by a long mile if bugs are a huge issue)..So at the end of the day, having a plethora, yet minimal amount of languages suited for different purposes is key to being a good programmer or software ‘house’. I can’t speak for development time (that is a none issue in a perfect world, and our aim should be to make the world perfect, because we’re engineers, not bankers or financiers). .So using the right tool for the right job is more important than which programming language is better. Oh and coming up with the right architecture for your system, might give you the ability to use more than one language for different parts of your system possibly making development time faster..I am a Pythonista myself, but I think it is fair to add . to the discussion about checked exceptions. It actually made me think they are not bad idea as I thought they are before..Two things.  In Java I use an IDE, which is a machine that helps me write code.  It can do this well, much better than any Python IDE can, because Java is strongly typed.  I use Jython to script my Java application, and Jython is great for building small applications, but it’s looseness makes it difficult to build anything large.  My Java app is 400K lines long and I can get around no problem because of Java’s precision.  Jython scripts that drive it get long and a bit unmanageable at 500 lines….agree. verbosity with Java is not a problem unless you write your codes in a text file, and no one does that for a big application. python is a great language and it has its own purpose. This is just another meaningless article..Productivity isn’t only measured at the time you actually write the code. Java is much more easy to maintain (static language in general are much easier to debug , test and maintain) it has some pretty powerful editors that shrink the productivity gap with dynamic languages..*Cough* Sublime Text 2 *cough*.A phenomenal text editor! (Also, the plugins/packages are written in Python — and did I mention that it has a Python terminal built-in, ctrl+~ ?).I understand that this is about productivity, but, it seems you’ve forgotten to talk about type checking. With Java, you are forced to fix type mismatches, while with Python, you can get type related errors without even realizing they are there. From personal experience, doing manual type checking sucks. Another thing I want to point out, is in some places, you’ve over complicated the Java code. For example, in the employee class, you could’ve just forced the calling method to pass all the variables at once, and shortened the code hugely. Also, in your tuple demonstration, you could’ve have just used an array..For me, the biggest hit against Python is it’s IDE, and the file setup. Pythons IDLE had a horrible font, that looks bad, and is to small. I also dont like the folder structure of Python. Unlike Java, it has no folder structure, leading to Python being to open ended, which lead to my next point..Based off your article it seems you like Python for its open endedness. For the ability to form and more variables without casting or declaring types. For the simplicity of the coding such as the ability to say print() rather than System.out.println();. But, the necessity to type everything, the structure,the rigidity of Java, is Java’s greatest triumph. When you see System.out.println(); you know that you are calling println(); from class out, from the basic system. With Python, print() tells you nothing. This might seem useless and verbose, but it has actually helped me..I needed to change the background of Swing’s JComboBox, but combobox.setBackground(Color.BLACK) did nothing at all. (I was using the basic UI) To fix it, I knew that the line of ancestry was JComboBox, Popup, List, and thanks to the well documented Java API (another one of Pythons down points) I new that that JList was where you set the background. This would have been much harder if Java allowed multipul inheritance..lordLabel = new JComboBox(LordLoader.lordList);.\n\t\tlordLabel.setBounds(220, 10, 100, 20);.\n\t\tlordLabel.setBorder(whiteBorder);.\n\t\tlordLabel.setForeground(Color.white);.\n\t\tlordLabel.setFont(new Font(“Trajan Pro”, Font.BOLD, 11));.\n\t\tfP.add(lordLabel, new Integer(1));.\n\t\tlordLabel.setForeground(Color.white);.\n\t\tlordLabel.setBackground(Color.black);.\n\t\tlordLabel.setUI(new BasicComboBoxUI());.\n\t\tObject lordChild = lordLabel.getAccessibleContext().getAccessibleChild(.\n\t\t\t\t0);.\n\t\tBasicComboPopup lordPopup = (BasicComboPopup) lordChild;.\n\t\tJList lordList = lordPopup.getList();.\n\t\tlordList.setBorder(whiteBorder);.\n\t\tlordList.setFixedCellHeight(15);.\n\t\tlordList.setSelectionBackground(Color.gray);.\n\t\tlordList.setSelectionForeground(Color.black);.I’d also like to go back to your point of verbosity. technically, Java could be much shorter than Python;.Java:.\npublic class mainClass{ public static void main(String[] args){ for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++){System.out.println(i);}}}.Python:.\nprint the integers from 1 to 9.\nfor i in range(1,10):.\n    print i.I know that over the web, intent is hard to uncover, so take the point about verbosity as a joke..Over all, your article was very well written, and very enlightening, but the one thing I wished you had touched upon, not because I want to hurt your opinion or anything, but rather, because I'd find it interesting from a Pythonian's point of view was the debugging, type checking, and things like that. Again, very well written article, thanks for this great resource.Unfortunately I cannot edit my older post (the one above), so I’ll add one thing to my IDE point. Java has more and better IDE’s than Python, such as Eclipse. (yes, Python can be coded in Eclipse, but when I make errors, it keeps telling me error in “JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC.” I’m sure you’ll agree with me that it isn’t an enlightening message. 🙂.Did you install PyDev? I dislike Eclipse (slow and fat), and prefer Notepad++ with the NppExec plugin. Beginners on windows probably prefer PyScripter. I’d use Eric for Python GUIs, and Pfaide if decadent..I’m a programmer from a diverse background and I’m considering learning Python as another string to my bow, so I’ve found this article and the associated comments extremely helpful in gaining an understanding into Python.  There’s one thing I’m not clear on though – aren’t we comparing apples to oranges?.To me it seems that Python is more analogous to PHP or Perl than Java.  Or am I missing something?.The stereotypes go that PHP is for websites and Pearl is unreadable. PHP still feels like an inconsistent speed hack to serve dynamic websites, and Python is a readable Perl that is less text-oriented. Java is a “write once, run anywhere” replacement for C++, and still is a lot like C++, complexity-wise..“There’s one thing I’m not clear on though – aren’t we comparing apples to oranges?”..Exactly. It’s all about comparing something cannot be compared. I’m a person who programs from time to time, just to create some simple tools working for me and performing repeatable and time-consuming tasks. I’ve tried a few different languages, including Java (works perfectly with modern IDEs, indeed; and your tasks may be even triggered on your old rusty mobile phone, which is really cool)..But for sure Python is a simplest and smartest tool for people like me. For me there is often a matter of “to code or not to code”. Some projects would not be done, if I was not able to achieve a goal in reasonable time (which is possible in Python only). From this perspective Python rules. But I would never say “it’s better than Java”. It’s just misunderstanding to compare them using criteria presented above..I am following on the tails of the last comment from Anonymous….I too am a programmer from a diverse background, having written in assembly, Fortran, Pascal, BASIC, C, C++, Java, Ruby, LISP and a few others.  I am looking at Python, not because I want an alternative to Java, or need yet another language to program in, but because I am looking at a hardware/OS environment that simply offers development in Python..In many cases, I find the choice of programming languages and environments are not free for us to chose but are instead thrust upon us by extenuating circumstances.  That said, there are still cases where we get to make a choice.  BTW, my introduction to Java was just one of those cases, using a software framework, provided by the company who’s systems we were utilizing for a project, that framework being written in Java..That said, as I go back to the beginning of the article and look at the objective, productivity, I am once again disappointed in the way this was presented.  Too many articles do the same DAMN thing, they talk like productivity centers around one thing, in this case language…this is simply not true!  Productivity starts long before any language is even used.  With the exception of ridiculous and meaningless tasks, like “Hello World”, which is misused abusively as a representation of or comparison between languages, I dare say a vast majority of programming tasks undertaken are large and complex (albeit, built on smaller components).  Productivity starts with design!.I’ll say it again to make sure it came across, “Productivity starts with design!”.  I read an article recently, and I wish I had taken the time to blast back at the author who claimed “flow-charting is dead”.  Anyone who undertakes a programming challenge without any planning is not a programmer, they are a tinkerer.  The amount of planning varies on the task and may range from a simple mental statement (“I’m gonna write a program to print ‘Hello World’ on the computer display”) to a 100+ page Statement Of Work (SOW) outlining all the interfaces to the system, storage requirements, accesses, processing, graphs, measurements, controls, the list can go on.  The thing is, the system should be DESIGNED before it is built.  And I think the good programmers out there who read this know and understand what I am talking about..So am I detracting from the article, the article after all was all about programming and here I am saying hold on, the article should have been about preparation?  Yes…and…no.  The article was about productivity, but chose to center that productivity around languages, and this is wrong.  Why?.Once you design what you want to build, the language begins to have less importance than the article suggests, and at the same time, more importance as may be understood by many of the discussions.  In a complete system design, once you know what you want to accomplish and how you want to go about it, details like static or dynamic take on less importance.  You already know in advance the majority of the data elements you want, so you can easily define them in advance in a static manner or define them as you go in a dynamic manner, little difference since you already defined them in the design!  However, as you design, you may also recognize certain code reuse, code complexity, task breakdowns, interfaces and other aspects for which one language may have advantages over another.  And yes, in this overall view, static vs. dynamic may play out as an advantage, either way..The point I am making, and will direct this at the author, is that there is a lot more that goes into the choice of language than just the ease at which certain things can be written.  I do realize you did not specifically make out that Python is always superior to Java, and although I have to agree with many that the format of the article did seem to present that Python was superior to Java, that doesn’t matter to me.  What disappoints me is that you presented an article, suggesting that the choice of language was THE thing to consider in productivity and it is but one little piece of the game..As I stated at the start, I have written code in numerous languages and to add to that, I have written everything from simple short applications, barely more than the infamous ‘Hello World’ to large machine and systems control applications and database systems.  I always start with a thorough plan and consider all aspects.  I typically work in C and Java (a complexity on its own) and often that is driven by the environment, the other people I work with, but that doesn’t stop me from looking at alternatives (just like the thing that brought me to this article).  I always consider not just the task at hand but the ‘reuse’ ability and future maintenance of the work I do.  I will not go so far out as to be the sole maintainer, leaving the company “holding the bag” if I leave, unless there are dramatic and very compelling reasons, usually coming down to efficiency and productivity at a significant level..I apologize to those reading my whole response for the long winded nature (that seems to be my nature, I never do anything short).  Please don’t make the choice of languages based on a misconception that one is necessarily easier or more appropriate than the other.  Any surviving language has a reason that it is surviving, and for the most part, that fact alone makes the language viable for any application.  Look at all aspects of the application, look at yourself, look at the others who may want to use or extend your application, and then chose the language that best fits the total environment..Reading of code happens more than writing of code, thus the code should be as clear and simple as possible. Python has clarity and simplicity as its main goals, and is more suited to quick adaption than Java. I do not recall any real-world project that did not require changes, as users rarely know exactly everything they’ll ever want in the product until they use it..python is a funny lanuages which not suited for enterprise level programming. Python never wins java or C# in future. It is just a advanced form of Old Basic (such as Qbasic) langauge.Too many people on here mention IDE’s. We are comparing two languages, not the tools that we use to code them with (imho, Eclipse is garbage, but that’s another topic all-together.).You can do in Python what you can in Java in a faction of the lines of code, but that doesn’t necessarily make it “better”. I am more productive in Python because I have less code to write, which also means fewer lines to debug (important!)..Clean and efficient code are what you need at the end of the day, and both languages can achieve this. There are just some simple tasks that Java makes too verbose and Python steps in to fill that void. If I had to choose between the two languages for my daily coding, I’d choose Python each and every time. For me, it’s the simple fact that I can get a heck of a lot more accomplished in Python [than Java] in a noticeably shorter amount of time..I’m new to Python. If Python, when used for gaming, derives its power and speed from diverting many CPU/GPU bound routines to C (or C++ in the case of Boost Python), who do they interface with data when Python uses dynamic types and C uses static types?.Let’s be honest guys, the choice between any programming languages is based on personal habits and taste. I tend to make a good few mistakes the first time around, and therefore java is my favourite language. I also find it less complex than almost all others. Sure, it uses up a bitchton of lines, but that doesn’t really matter once the application is effective..I read almost all comments and I there is one point that all of you missed! The logo is important for productivity!.The Python logo is obviously a snake. The name of the language, however, was based on Monty Python. So what this means is that you are going to have good laughs when the python bytes you. Specially when the code is too long to debug or understand..The Java logo is a cup of coffee. What this means is that you are going to need coffee when programming in Java or you will fall asleep. In fact you are going to need loads of coffee when your code is near production stage. BTW I don’t drink coffee, so my job is twice as hard..Jython is when you give coffee to a snake. Jython users are people that drank toomuch coffee and over time it doesn’t have any effect anymore. Since the python needs to sleep, the solution is giving coffee so that Java programmers can also have laughs at late hours of the day..And that folks is a true story..I know that you are aiming to make the code examples comparable, but do you have to use camelCase in Python?  The Python conventions call to use underscores for variable and function names, and CamelCase only for class names (and camelCase where the first letter is lowercase nowhere)..Comments are longer than post, then Java is better.I know Java very little and I do not know Python ( which I am looking at right now as a free alternative to C# ). I immediatelly feel from where the power of python comes – STL-like programming style on collections. Long ago I have got to work with STL and was totally blown by its incredible power. ( STL is an extension of C++ ). Is there something like that in Java? Which language is going to win eventually? ( Besiges unbreakable C++ place under the sun ) The one which realises STL-like  programming. Period..There is nothing like that in Java. You might want to look into Scala instead. It is Java compatible, has the STL-like programming and even more. When it comes to data structures I do see one weakness in python when compared with Java: you cannot choose your data structure implementation..In Java when you do something like “SortedMap m = new TreeMap()” you know you are using a tree, which is actually a red-black tree. You can also choose a HashMap and so on. In python you only have one choice, the dictionary. How is python dictionary implemented? I don’t know but it seem to be an open hash table..If you want to go with JVM, Scala goes one step further, you can choose your data structure implementation, has STL-like programming, supports functional programming, etc. I see it kind of like a fusion between Java and Python and some functional languages. You might want to look into Clojure also, although that’s a functional language..Jython is also an option, but you can easily (ctypes, Cython, SWIG, etc.) extend CPython with the exact data models you’d like, e.g. . .On Wed, May 1, 2013 at 12:50 PM, Python Conquers The Universe  wrote: .> ** >   commented: “There is nothing like that in Java.

        "Just 10 years ago, Python didn't even make the top 5 most popular programming languages. Given today's rapid advancements in technology, what programming language should your kid learn?.Posted on Jun 21, 2021.They say the only constant in life is change. Ten or so years ago, Netflix made most of its money in DVD rentals and Uber exclusively offered pickups in luxury black cars. As the tech within their respective industries evolved, these two companies adapted their service models accordingly. .Just like Netflix and Uber, programming languages have continually changed to keep up with the ever-evolving technological environment.  There are over . in use today, and recent history shows that the “preferred” languages continue to .. .In 2010, Python didn't make the top 5 most popular programming languages, with Java being over 3 times more popular. Fast forward to 2020, and Python is now #1 on the popularity list..If you're a parent reading this, I am sure you are wanting to know what language will top this list in five, ten, or fifteen years from now when your child is entering the workforce. Unfortunately, I don't have the magic ball to give you that answer, but I can give you some insight into why Codeverse believes it will be different. .Have you heard of the programming languages ., ., or .? Probably not. But you probably have heard about machine learning and AI, where these new languages become incredibly powerful. According to a recent quote from MIT professor Alan Edelman in ., .\"The release of Julia 1.0 signals that Julia is now ready to change the technical world by combining the high-level productivity and ease of use of Python and R with the lightning-fast speed of C++\"..Is that now three languages that your child needs to learn to be prepared for what might be the popular language of the future? This is exactly why Codeverse doesn't specifically teach any of today's most popular languages. We provide kids with something better..Within 10 years, a large subset of today’s kids will be entering the workforce. And very specific technical knowledge, such as the syntax of one programming language, likely won’t be relevant. However, creativity, strategy, intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration always will be..Andreas Schleicher, the Director of Education and Skills at OEDC, echoes our thinking in his blog post, “Should Schools Teach Coding?” .In that spirit, we developed a programming language called .KidScript is a real programming language which allows all the common concepts from professional languages such as Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Python. KidScript has a strict, easy to understand syntax, which allows kids to start creating their own projects immediately, and learn by doing. .KidScript is fully optimized for young minds. It was designed to be approachable and removes the unnecessary complexities of the more adult languages with an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax..“The best way to learn is by doing” says Craig Ulliott, Codeverse CEO. With KidScript, there’s a big emphasis on creativity and a tight relationship between the code and what the kids are building. This makes it really easy to get started, and everything much easier to understand. It’s object-oriented and includes a library of familiar things, such as cats and dogs, which kids can use to build apps and games. .The developer environment is friendly and intuitive, encouraging kids to interact and experiment with their code. The editor provides hints, tips, real-time error messages, and many other features designed to make coding accessible to first-time learners. Kids are able to dive into projects and learn as they go, seeing their ideas come to life one line of code at a time..As kids develop a better understanding of how different elements of code work together, they can push themselves to learn more advanced concepts and add increasingly complex functionality to their apps and games. .Craig specifically developed KidScript to nurture fundamental skills that translate to any coding language. As he points out, “There are a lot of other toys and games that introduce kids to coding, but they all underestimate what kids are capable of.”.‍.© Copyright 2019 Americademy, Inc.",

        "more.At Devmountain, we’ve been helping individuals seeking to change their career into the tech industry since 2013, and now we’re expanding our programs to include more of the skills that today’s employers are looking for. Our President and General Manager, Hideo Hansen, discusses three of our new course offerings, and what kind of support remote students can expect. Plus, he shares details about our new Coding Basics course geared toward total coding beginners, whether you are pivoting into a tech career or just want to add a new skill to your toolbox..Devmountain has been teaching programming and Quality Assurance (QA) for nearly a decade! What are the major changes that students can expect in 2021?.We have an enthusiastic career-support team that has been working with employers to learn which competencies are most valued as technology advances. There were three skill sets we knew we could start teaching right away: Python Engineering, Java Engineering, and Data Analytics. So we’ve added 16-week courses in those areas to our lineup..We also modified our popular Web Development program to match the same format, which meant adding 3 weeks of content to that program..In addition to those career-focused courses, we’ve also added a 4-week . class. This is a great option for anyone who thinks they might be interested in a full Devmountain course but wants to take Devmountain for a little test drive first. We’ve also found it’s very helpful for professionals who aren’t necessarily looking to switch careers, but who would benefit from knowing a few coding essentials. Many of us aren’t developers and we have a hard time communicating back and forth because there isn’t a common language. This course can help..Finally, we are working hard to add additional programs in 2021 to respond to student and market demands more quickly. If you’re not finding what you hoped for ., please let us know about it! We absolutely want a strong student voice guiding us as we plan for the future..Could you walk us through the . that Devmountain will teach in this new format?.: The class covers HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. It’s a great way to prepare for one of our career-oriented courses, to learn if you like coding, or to skill up and have a more robust resume. Anecdotally, our whole marketing team chose to take an early version of this course. When it was over, they were all surprised by how much it helped them with their jobs..I think it goes to show that in 2021, many roles are becoming tech roles, and the more you understand about the different roles you work with, the better off you are..: This is closely related to the web development program we’ve been teaching for years, but with a few improvements. The course has always had more of a front-end focus, and now that we have two programs that are concentrated on back-end development, we’ve leaned into that front-end focus even more. This makes a great program for our students who discover they love front-end work, while those who learn they love back-end work can transfer over to one of our engineering courses. Additionally, we’ve added more instruction about the fundamentals of development work — broadly applicable skills and topics that can make students better employees regardless of specific roles or organizations..: Python is a language we’re frequently asked about, and we’re thrilled to be adding this course to our mix. Many think Python is highly readable and has a straightforward syntax, which makes it an ideal first language to learn and grow with. Like all of our new programs, the first half is devoted to learning coding fundamentals, things that will be useful no matter what specialization you pursue. Not only is this a sound instructional philosophy, but it also gives our students a chance to make sure they’ve chosen the right program..For those who learn or already know they want to specialize in Python, in the back half of the course they will learn how to use Python and other tools to build object-oriented programs..: A lot of people think Java can be difficult to learn and master, but those who are eager for the challenge will find that Java is used in a lot of applications, in a lot of industries, and in a lot of ways. After learning some fundamentals, those who choose to specialize in Java development will learn to use Java and other languages and tools like SQL, Spring Boot, and GitHub, to build object-oriented programs. We hope the effort it takes to learn this language well will help these students stand apart for any company looking to add some new Java engineers..: As we all are moving across the internet, downloading apps, spending time on social media, and more, there has been an explosion of data collection. Many companies are hoping to better collect, sort, and meaningfully understand data, which makes data analytics an interesting tech field — it’s not just for people who want to build apps or software, but could be for marketers, accountants, managers, and or just about any business professional who is looking to get insights from quantitative information. In this 16-week course, students will learn the fundamentals of development before learning to use tools like Python and SQL to manipulate and understand data..We will also continue to teach our legacy iOS development, QA testing, and UX Design programs while we explore how to modify those to match the same format as our new programs..Is the new bootcamp format offered online and in-person?.We are launching the new programs online, but we hope to offer all the new courses in person this summer or fall. We miss seeing all our students on campus! We will continue to offer Web Development, iOS Development, UX Design, and QA Testing remotely or in-person as local public health guidelines allow..But whether our courses are delivered remotely or in person, we’ve worked hard to keep the bootcamp style — providing live lectures, real-time help, and lots of hands-on learning upfront, before turning students loose to work on their own projects, applying what they’ve learned with some gentle guidance..Should applicants have a technical background before applying for Devmountain?.Our courses are designed to be beginner-friendly. Of course, the more experience and ability you have, the easier things will be. We often find that a student's level of commitment is much more important than their incoming knowledge. For anyone who is worried about their preparation, something like the Coding Basics course can be helpful..Has the . changed for this new bootcamp format?.Nope! The admissions process still consists of:.I’ve learned over time that some people get nervous about the consultation or the skill review like it’s a job interview where they have to prove they are worthy of moving toward a career in tech. The truth is we really want what is best for our students, and the consultation and skill review help us make sure what we offer is aligned with the applicant’s goals and to help give them an idea of how ready they are for the program..We don’t expect you to be an expert and it’s okay to not have a lot of relevant experience. We are really looking for passion, commitment, and goal alignment, not business attire and a resume..What kinds of projects will students work on in the new courses?.This is a bootcamp, so the projects start early. Some projects will give you a chance to learn on your own, while others provide an opportunity to check your own progress and understanding. As students go further, they will begin working on projects that can go into a portfolio. Choosing those projects is usually a collaboration between students, who know what their interests are, and staff, who know what is feasible given the constraints of a highly-compressed training experience..Obviously, different students in different specializations will make different projects. One of the great things about working at Devmountain is seeing the original and creative projects students build. At one end of the spectrum, we often see practical things like classification, inventory, or scheduling programs, and on the other end of the spectrum, we see fun projects, like digital adaptations of popular games, programs that can tell you where the “best” bars are located in a specific city, or even an application that will tell you when the avocados you bought are ripe..No matter what the project is, we’re committed to helping students do work that will show off their personalities, passions, and new abilities. We want our students to come out of Devmountain looking good..Does Devmountain offer a prep course to ramp up new students for this new bootcamp format?.Yes! We are offering a . course, which covers HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. It’s just a month-long, and classes are held in the evenings and Saturday mornings. Additionally, if students are looking for more specific guidance, they are always welcome to talk to our admissions team. They are happy to work in collaboration with our instructors to help students prepare and we’re often giving out recommendations for books, videos, or online courses..If a student is struggling with the bootcamp, how can they receive extra support?.Our health as an organization is deeply connected with the well-being of our students. The reality is bootcamps are hard and most students will hit a stretch where they feel like they are struggling. When they hit those rough patches, we will be there to offer support. In addition to our great team of instructors, mentors, and subject-matter experts, we also have a team of student experience and community managers. These in-class and outside-of-class teams meet regularly and discuss student progress name by name..Sometimes we will reach out to students to offer extra help and support before they reach out to us..In cases where we don’t reach out first, students can contact instructional staff or their assigned experience manager. Together they can meet to discuss the issues — whether they’re in or outside of class — and make a specific plan to help the student get through the course..In addition to these more formal channels, we also do our best to promote robust communities where students who are further ahead in a program can help those who are just starting, or where students with more experience in a cohort can help those who might have less. We believe a healthy, supportive community of learners is an invaluable resource and potential teaching tool, whether you’re the one seeking help or offering guidance..What do career prep and job placement look like in this new format?.Our . team will help students prepare their resumes, hold networking events, and even help students with interview prep. They are eager to help and love nothing more than when a student partners with them to try to find their new career..After graduation, our students can continue their journey with ongoing access to the graduate success team, career fairs, and invitations to networking events to help get them in front of tech employers looking for fresh talent. Our graduate success team meets regularly to discuss every student — they aren’t happy until our students are happy..Do you have any tips for new students who are looking to get the most out of this new bootcamp format?.Career changes can be hard, and it’s easy to procrastinate a journey like this. But the sooner you begin, the sooner you’ll be on the path to a new job — hopefully, one that is fulfilling and that you will be proud of. The best part of my job is seeing all our students’ hard work pay off. Nothing changes unless you do. If you believe you want to do this, but are sitting on the fence, then I’d encourage you to go for it..If you aren’t sure if you want to do this, fill out an application, talk to a counselor, and get a little experience with our skill review..Most of us learn what we want by getting out, taking the next step, and having an experience rather than sitting around and thinking..At Devmountain, we are passionate about providing engaging experiences that change lives. We are always trying to make Devmountain more and more accessible to everyone, but none of that does any good unless you are willing to bet on yourself. Betting on yourself is scary, but we see students do it regularly and it’s inspirational. It’s your life! Be bold and make a lasting impression.",

        "Software Engineering Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for professionals, academics, and students working within the systems development life cycle. It only takes a minute to sign up..Q&A for work.Connect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search..Over on SO I came across a question regarding which platform, Java or Python is best for developing on Google AppEngine. Many people were boasting of the increased productivity gained from using Python over Java. One thing I would say about the Python vs Java productivity argument, is Java has excellent IDE's to speed up development whereas Python is really lacking in this area because of its dynamic nature..So even though I prefer to use Python as a language, I don't believe it gives quite the productivity boost compared to Java especially when using a new framework. Obviously if it were Java vs Python and the only editor you could use was VIM then Python would give you a huge productivity boost but when IDE's are brought into the equation its not as clear cut..I think Java's merits are often solely evaluated on a language level and often on out dated assumptions but Java has many benefits external to the language itself, e.g the JVM (often criticized but offers huge potential), excellent IDE's and tools, huge numbers of third party libraries, platforms etc...Question: Does Python, or related dynamic languages, really give the huge productivity boosts often talked about (with consideration given to using new frameworks and working with medium to large applications)?.One of Python's major advantages is its \"batteries included\" philosophy: an extensive and simple to use standard  library. In Java, just reading a text file requires several lines of code, nested readers and such. In Python it's .. This will definitely be a huge productivity boost especially in quick prototyping. Python the language is also generally less verbose, which is not a bad thing (although I think the importance of verbosity vs. conciseness is often overemphasized)..However, if you're already working on some framework, such as GAE, then I would expect the differences to be much smaller, and mainly up to one's personal fluency in the language. You'll be mostly just wiring the framework together with the syntax of your choice, and there Python's great standard library helps little..Here are my 2 cents. In my experience Python is good for small to middle-sized\nprojects whereas for larger projects I am more productive with Java..In general, I can use a dynamically typed language like Python (or PHP) for\nsmaller projects: it is not too complex, you want to get it done fast and\nthere is not too much that can go wrong. In this case, I find that Python\ncan be more practical to use..However, when I have to develop a larger piece of software, I prefer a\nstatically typed language like Java because I prefer the compiler to perform\nas many checks as possible for me. My experience is that in larger projects\nI have to spend more time fixing bugs with Python than with Java, so I do not\nbother if it takes a bit more to write the code in Java because this will\nsave time later..I am much more productive in more powerful languages like Python or Ruby.  It doesn't matter if some of the Java code can be generated by an IDE.  There is more code to read and maintain.  It takes more time to wade through repetitive code and find the important parts, and more time to change it.   It's fine that Eclipse can convert.to:.but every time I open the class I will see that junk and have to skim past it to find the interesting parts.  Also, during maintenance, errors can be introduced into generated code..I would much rather see:.To me, the need for an IDE to work effectively with Java is a good reason to choose another language..Perhaps more powerfully, compare this Ruby code:.against similar Java code:.The Ruby code is a direct translation of the specification: the average weight of people taller than 200 (cm).  A comment would be utterly redundant..The Java code requires considerable work to both write and read..Paul Graham makes a convincing argument for brevity in programming languages in this ..  Having done some graduate level mathematics, I find his argument compelling, and the arguments against brevity weak.  Certainly a single line in a high level language may be harder to understand than a single line in a low level language, just as a partial differential equation is harder to comprehend than a simple addition.  But a single line in a powerful language is easier to comprehend than the five or ten lines it replaces.  Imagine reading a math text that was written using words instead of symbols..I moved from Java to Python a few years ago and personally feel that I am more productive.  As @Joonas points out, a lot of the productivity comes from the packaged library.  But some of it is from the language itself.  I can't imagine not having dictionaries, list comprehensions, higher order functions & a shell..Keep in mind that if you already known Java it'll take awhile to become fluent in Python..This is a bit of an old question but I'd like add my $.03. I think that it depends a lot on the way you think as well. I for one really can't stand dynamic, interpreted languages. I am, on the other hand, a huge fan of statically-typed languages. Sure, using Java can be more verbose but I find it easier to read and maintain once it's all said and done. I find Python, Ruby, and Perl to be extremely difficult to read (for me). I just can't wrap my head around it even though I've tried. That said, I can write code in Scala just fine and it's no big deal. I think it depends on what you are comfortable with. At the end of the day Java is going to be a lot more powerful; more so than Ruby, Python, or Perl. The JVM is a compelling piece of technology and learning to harness the power of it could prove very beneficial for you..I find that Python, Ruby, Javascript and SQL are much more productive than compiled languages such as Java because those languages have a very quick feedback loop. You can run a few lines of code on a command line and immediately know if the code is correct or not. If it throws exceptions, you know immediately. With Java you have to compile, package and deploy which can often take minutes for large systems, and this results in a very slow feedback cycle. .The fast feedback cycle lets  you quickly iterate to a good solution, and that is what makes dynamic languages more productive. .I've been doing a lot more python recently and have been a java programmer for a long time, and for brand new development, I think I'm quite a bit more productive in python. a lot of fairly simple things in java can be a bit tedious, like file/stream processing, reading stuff from a URL, serializing XML, etc. by \"tedious\", I mean what takes you 5 lines of code in java often seems to take only one in python. using the right tools, like guava or another collections API, can really help with this however..I guess I'm saying that one advantage of python is it ships with many features that you need to use a 3rd party library in java to get..all that said, for certain things I would be far more productive in java than I could be in python, particularly when it comes to refactoring and working with large codebases, etc..\r\n                                                By clicking “Post Your Answer”, you agree to our ., . and .\n.\r\n                        Your privacy\r\n                    .\r\n                        By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our ..\r\n                    ",

Furthermore, as it was specifically designed to be a language that can be learned quite easily, it has been adopted by many who don’t come from a . background..However, Python does have some flaws like its dependence on indentation for blocks.

Let's take a look at why these languages are popular for video processing. Netflix uses them both and they have one of the most popular video content platforms in the world. Much has been written about Netflix when it comes to what programming language it's built with. Dig around online, and you'll find iconic quotes like these: .\"..\" -Andy Glover, Director of Productivity Engineering at Netflix.\".\" -Pythonistas at Netflix, coordinated by Amjith Ramanujam and edited by Ellen Livengood .Netflix has used Java and Python to deliver an exceptional customer experience at least as far back as 2013. A Netflix blog post titled ‘Python at Netflix,’ dated Mar 11, 2013, states that: .\"Developers at Netflix have the freedom to choose the technologies best suited for the job. More and more, developers turn to Python due to its rich batteries-included standard library, succinct and clean yet expressive syntax, large developer community, and the wealth of third party libraries one can tap into to solve a given problem.\" .It’s interesting to note that when permitted to choose anything, developers started in Java, then Python grew in popularity. Today they continue using both, though a number of articles suggest they are shifting more and more to use Python. .Netflix initially chose Java because of its scalability and ability to easily run anywhere. They use open source Java tools to monitor, upgrade, and scale their services. Their engineers continuously deliver new features, and Java processes are constantly running during a customer's use of Netflix. Netflix's . \"The bread and butter of Netflix involves using data to recommend shows that customers might like. Everyone at Netflix plays a role in either capturing that data or making use of that data. Our business units can make changes quickly, partly because the entire infrastructure is built on Java.\" Their engineers also encode videos using Java on Linux computers. .Over time, .. They rewrote some Java processes using Python, and they also use Python for security. It's used for risk classification, security automation and vulnerability identification. Like Java, Python is often used in Netflix's recommendation algorithms as well as to serve content to viewers. Amazingly, ...Netflix chose Python because it's one of the fastest growing languages in terms of popularity, it offers numerous modules that are great for video processing and data science, and its an industry standard for a lot of animated and VFX content.

Java developers are setting the pace in big data, cloud services, software-defined networks (SDN) and more. Even in the mobile space, Java is extremely popular, thanks to Android. But the future is up for grabs..The most recent .puts Java in the number one slot, and growing. Worries about problems in the Java developer community, corporate stewardship, and other signs of its proclaimed pending death have been greatly exaggerated..Python is no slouch, either. It is listed as number five on the same Index, up from spot eight a year ago. If I’m a developer making a choice between Java and Python, should I depend on these kinds of usage numbers?.The power of Python lies in what it may become. Philip Guo wrote an article in Communications of the ACM showing that “..” In addition, International Business Times recently noted that . as the most taught “language” in primary schools..Why teach Python instead of Java, which was the dominant teaching language for the past decade? What are the implications for the future?.Most people think that Python is just easier for introductory courses. Young programmers enter the workforce and graduate to Java. Despite the “first love” of Python, usage statistics seem to indicate that this might be case. But is there more to it?.Remember that for the past decade both high school AP courses and CS introductory courses at universities were based on Java, not Python. The move to Python is recent. Truth is, we don’t yet know how this will impact the workforce..Although the forced use of tabs is often annoying to people new to Python, it helps make Python one of the most human-readable programming languages in wide use. I would argue that it is the most readable. This means it easier to collaborate on code and perform code reviews..True: tabs and indentation are a subtle difference. I also acknowledge that Python has features, such as dynamically-typed variables, that make it difficult to read in some cases..However, Python’s overall syntax makes it a better fit for a GitHub-loving world where code is meant to be read by groups of people, not just the programmer who wrote it..While Python isn’t as popular as Java, it is in wide use. This is going to be important for programmers that learned Python in introductory college CS classes and stuck with it. Companies using Python include YouTube, Google, Pinterest, Reddit, Quora, Bank of America, Diebold, Lockheed Martin, NASA, Boeing, US Army and many more..Here’s some statistics on Python showing the strength of the community:.According to PayScale, the average salary for a person with Python skills is $103,422. On LinkedIn, the Python Professionals forums has 35,734 members. There’s no indication that Python salaries are higher than Java salaries. The point I want to make is that the salaries are good enough to make a decent living. It’s not just a language used in education. Python makes an appearance in a number of industries, including IT, DevOps, system administration, software development (web), scientific computing, gaming, financial services, legal, healthcare and more..Data scientists and data analysts are hailed as hot job titles for the past few years. Most data scientists are using R or Python, not Java. As this role becomes more important, and big data continues its upward trend, it will help Python more than Java. Whether Python will dominate over R is open to debate, which I would love to discuss in the future..The problem with looking at the current big data, Android, and SDN development trends is that the trends are already established. You’re looking at a snapshot of today..Although we don’t know what development languages will gain strength, we do know that a vast pool of people will be armed with Python programming skills..The Python community benefits from a combination of a large base of people with Python skills and easy code readability for efficient peer review — the ease by which ideas can be turned into functional apps, therefore outshining Java as a rapid prototyping tool — just to name a few strengths..My bet is that the future development trends are going to be set by Python developers..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\t\t\t\t\tFeature image: “.” with permission from .. .

        "I was recently looking at the source of a wxPython-based GUI application, about 45.5KLOC in size, not counting the libraries used (e.g. Twisted). The code was written by Java developers who are relatively new to Python, and it suffers from some performance issues (like a 30-second startup time). In examining the code, I found that they had done lots of things that make sense in Java, but which suck terribly in Python. Not because “Python is slower than Java”, but because there are easier ways to accomplish the same goals in Python, that wouldn’t even be . in Java..So, the sad thing is that these poor folks worked much, much harder than they needed to, in order to produce much more code than they needed to write, that then performs much more slowly than the equivalent idiomatic Python would. Some examples:.A static method in Java does not translate to a Python classmethod. Oh sure, it results in more or less the same effect, but the goal of a classmethod is actually to do something that’s usually not even possible in Java (like inheriting a non-default constructor). The idiomatic translation of a Java static method is usually a module-level function, not a classmethod or staticmethod. (And static final fields should translate to module-level constants.).This isn’t much of a performance issue, but a Python programmer who has to work with Java-idiom code like this will be rather irritated by typing Foo.Foo.someMethod when it should just be Foo.someFunction. But do note that calling a classmethod involves an additional memory allocation that calling a staticmethod or function does not..Oh, and all those Foo.Bar.Baz attribute chains don’t come for free, either. In Java, those dotted names are looked up by the compiler, so at runtime it really doesn’t matter how many of them you have. In Python, the lookups occur at runtime, so each dot counts. (Remember that in Python, “Flat is better than nested”, although it’s more related to “Readability counts” and “Simple is better than complex,” than to being about performance.).Got a switch statement? The Python translation is a hash table, not a bunch of if-then statments. Got a bunch of if-then’s that wouldn’t be a switch statement in Java because strings are involved? It’s still a hash table. The CPython dictionary implementation uses one of the most highly-tuned hashtable implementations in the known universe. No code that you write yourself is going to work better, unless you’re the genetically-enhanced love child of Guido, Tim Peters, and Raymond Hettinger..XML is not the answer. It is not even the question. To paraphrase ., “Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use XML.” Now they have two problems.”.This is a different situation than in Java, because compared to Java code, XML is agile and flexible. Compared to Python code, XML is a boat anchor, a ball and chain. In Python, XML is something you use for interoperability, not your core functionality, because you simply don’t need it for that. In Java, XML can be your savior because it lets you implement domain-specific languages and increase the flexibility of your application “without coding”. In Java, avoiding coding is an advantage because coding means recompiling. But in Python, more often than not, code is . to write than XML. And Python can process code much, much faster than your code can process XML. (Not only that, but you have to . the XML processing code, whereas Python itself is already written for you.).If you are a Java programmer, do not trust your instincts regarding whether you should use XML as part of your core application in Python. If you’re not implementing an existing XML standard for interoperability reasons, creating some kind of import/export format, or creating some kind of XML editor or processing tool, then Just Don’t Do It. At all. Ever. Not even just this once. Don’t even think about it. Drop that schema and put your hands in the air, now! If your application or platform will be used by Python developers, they will only thank you for not adding the . of using XML to their workload..(The only exception to this is if your target audience really really needs XML for some strange reason. Like, they refuse to learn Python and will only pay you if you use XML, or if you plan to give them a nice GUI for editing the XML, and the GUI in question is something that somebody else wrote for editing XML and you get to use it for free. There are also other, very rare, architectural reasons to need XML. Trust me, they don’t apply to your app. If in doubt, explain your use case for XML to an experienced Python developer. Or, if you have a thick skin and don’t mind being laughed at, try explaining to a Lisp programmer why your application needs XML!).Getters and setters are evil. Evil, evil, I say! Python objects are not Java beans. Do not write getters and setters. This is what the ‘property’ built-in is for. And do not take that to mean that you should write getters and setters, and then wrap them in ‘property’. That means that until you prove that you need anything more than a simple attribute access, .. They are a waste of CPU time, but more important, they are a waste of programmer time. Not just for the people writing the code and tests, but for the people who have to read and understand them as well..In Java, you have to use getters and setters because using public fields gives you no opportunity to go back and change your mind later to using getters and setters. So in Java, you might as well get the chore out of the way up front. In Python, this is silly, because you can start with a normal attribute and change your mind at any time, without affecting any clients of the class. So, don’t write getters and setters..Code duplication is quite often a necessary evil in Java, where you must often write the same method over and over with minor variations (usually because of static typing constraints). It is not necessary or desirable to do this in Python (except in certain . cases of inlining a few performance-critical functions). If you find yourself writing the same function over and over again with minor variations, it’s time to learn about closures. They’re really not that scary..Here’s what you do. You write a function that contains a function. The inner function is a template for the functions that you’re writing over and over again, but with variables in it for all the things that vary from one case of the function to the next. The outer function takes parameters that have the same names as those variables, and returns the inner function. Then, every place where you’d otherwise be writing yet another function, simply call the outer function, and assign the return value to the name you want the “duplicated” function to appear. Now, if you need to change how the pattern works, you only have to change it in one place: the template..In the application/platform I looked at, just . highly trivial application of this technique could have cut out hundreds of lines of deadweight code. Actually, since the particular boilerplate has to be used by developers developing plugins for the platform, it will save many, many more hundreds of lines of third-party developer code, while simplifying what those developers have to learn..This is only the tip of the iceberg for Java->Python mindset migration, and about all I can get into right now without delving into an application’s specifics. Essentially, if you’ve been using Java for a while and are new to Python, .. Your instincts are tuned to Java, not Python. Take a step back, and above all, ...To do this, become more demanding of Python. Pretend that Python is a magic wand that will miraculously do whatever you want without you needing to lifting a finger. Ask, “how does Python already solve my problem?” and “What Python language feature most resembles my problem?” You will be absolutely astonished at how often it happens that thing you need is already there in some form. In fact, this phenomenon is so common, even among experienced Python programmers, that the Python community has a name for it. We call it “Guido’s time machine”, because sometimes it seems as though that’s the only way he could’ve known what we needed, before we knew it ourselves..So, if you don’t feel like you’re at least ten times more productive with Python than Java, chances are good that you’ve been forgetting to use the time machine! (And if you miss your Java IDE, consider the possibility that it’s because your Python program is much more complex than it needs to be.).You must be . to post a comment..Thank you very much!  Your post resonates with me a great deal.  I switched from Java to Python a while back, but I don’t have a CS background, so I’d like to request some clarification.  .First, when you say “hash table”, in Python I think dictionary.  Is that correct?  If so, does that mean you would create a dict that has the case value as the key and the appropriate callable as the item?  How would you organize your code?  Could you point me towards an example in, say, PEAK somewhere?.Second question, regarding closures, the concept seems straight-forward, but could you again point me at an example in working code?.Again, thank you for this post..Nice blog.  Perhaps you should formalize this a bit and publish it as an article. 😉.Can we guess what wxPython application your talking about?.While I see most of the points, the “swith->hash-table” conversion is a bit confusing. Are you suggesting that for each option that would have originally been the “body” of the case statement, I should write a function, store it in a dict (w/ the key as the case value), and then look that up? Seems to loose some of the information attached w/ the switch….Very interesting.  As a Python programmer (mostly, over the last couple of years) who’s just returning to Java, I find some of the same points applying in reverse.  But what’s much more frustrating is the drop in language level; so much of what’s done for you in Python needs to be put together painfully and explicitly in Java.  And don’t get me started on static typing….ben.What advice do you have for translating multithreaded Java applications? Does Python have any nice concurrency semantics that transcend Threads?.When does part 2 come out?!! Another problem I had was trying to figure out how to do reflection in Python, comming from writing reflection in Java. Also it would be good to have a section on dynamic code generation and evaluation. Dynamic code evalutaion in Python is an extremly powerful tool!.Thanks,.LHJ.Yes, hash table == dictionary. For simple examples, check out the “pickle” and “copy” modules in the Python standard library, which look up types in a dictionary to get the functions they need. A more sophisticated example is generic functions, about which I’ve posted several blog items here recently..Regarding closure examples, most of the ones I can think of in PEAK are a lot more complex than the simple form I described here, so I’ll make up a silly example. Suppose you are making lots of functions like:.def addOne(x): return x+1.def addTwo(x): return x+2.then you can make something like:.def makeAdder(addend):.… def add_it(x): return x+addend.… return add_it.and use it like this:.addOne = makeAdder(1).addTwo = makeAdder(2).Which is roughly equivalent to the original definitions of addOne and addTwo..As for losing context in converting a switch to a hash table, I would say, yes, you can lose context, but usually there’s a simple way to structure things so that it’s not too bad. However, I’ve also seen lots of code where switch-like blocks do nothing more than select another constant value to return, or each item is another function call anyway..I probably should have qualified this point more, or at least pointed out that there are other good reasons to use a dictionary when you’re making choices between behaviors, such as the fact that third parties can potentially add items to a dictionary, but they can’t add more branches to your if-then blocks. This is more of an issue for platforms and frameworks than for applications, of course..I think first-class functions can save a lot of time, without being quite as sophisticated as closures.  Their use is certainly a common Python idiom, and not present in Java (AFAIK)..A typical example might be some pipelined code, where a function produces output.  Say it sorts between “good” and “bad”.  You don’t want it to simply return two lists, because you have (or want) to act on its results immediately..You could create objects and interfaces and whatnot (for a Java feel), but functions will do.  The signature looks like “sort_virtue(input, good_func, bad_func)”; it calls “good_func(item)” when it encounters a good item, or “bad_func(item)” when it gets a bad one..When you are starting out, maybe you are lazy and just want to collect them.  You make a list “good” and “bad”.  You pass in “good.append” for good_func, and “bad.append” for bad_func.  Later on you can refine, if you need to.  If you need lots of state and whatnot, you can create a class with a “__call__” method.  You’ve lost little future flexibility, but you’ve saved a lot of time — no new classes, no new interfaces, no new abstractions, and short documentation..There’s lots of other similar use cases where passing functions around is fast and powerful.  It’s a good first step on your way to closures, and it certainly has to be mastered first..Wonderful !.It’s not the first time I read from you but this time I add your name on my small personnal python-gurus-must-read list : Those people with high-level thoughts yet understandable by me. Reading your prose give me the delightful feeling to be intelligent 🙂.re:”””What advice do you have for translating multithreaded Java applications? Does Python have any nice concurrency semantics that transcend Threads?”””.There aren’t very many good reasons to use pre-emptive threads, in any language.  Co-operative multitasking is far less prone to non-reproducible heisenbugs..In the case of Python, there are many asynchronous toolkits (e.g. Twisted, peak.events, and Medusa) designed to make it easier to do co-operative multitasking in Python.  There’s also Stackless Python, an alternative CPython implementation which builds ultra-lightweight co-operative threads into the language and libraries.  And, last but not least, there’s the Greenlets library which can work with regular CPython to give you Stackless-like task switching..re:”””Another problem I had was trying to figure out how to do reflection in Python, comming from writing reflection in Java. Also it would be good to have a section on dynamic code generation and evaluation.”””.Well, in Python you don’t have to use .class to go from the name of a class to having an object you can reflect on, because in Python, classes are already an object.  The ‘dir()’ function gives you a list of a class’ attribute names.  The ‘inspect’ module lets you examine function signatures.  The ‘new’ module lets you create new “classic” classes, modules, functions, and code objects..You can create new-style classes them with the ‘type()’ callable: ‘type(name,bases_tuple,classdict)’ returns a new class with the given names, bases, and class dictionary (containing non-inherited class attributes and methods)..Using the ‘new’ module, you can create code objects from a bytecode string, much like you can create a class from bytecode in Java.  But, it’s usually easier to use the ‘compile’ builtin to compile a string with your desired source code.  Or, use the ‘exec’ statement to execute some source code..I’m not going into a lot of detail here, but it’s hard to talk about these things without specific use cases.  Mostly, my article was about some of the issues I encountered in one specific application.  The only reflection/code-generation issue it had was using ‘getattr()’ unnecessarily; i.e. with constant strings.  .I suspect this is because in the same situation in Java you would have had to use the reflection API to do what it was doing.  In Python, it suffices to say ‘classvar.foo’, where in Java you’d need to call some kind of field introspection method on ‘classvar’ if it was an instance of java.lang.Class (or whatever the type I’m thinking of is.).Please….Just because some people aren’t experts in one language or another doesn’t mean one language is better than the other. .Anyone whos coded/ported in multiple languages knows that you do things differently in each. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Its also why its hard to be an export on any one language..I’ve been working with ada code. We have 3 types..Straight ada- Written from ground up. Is easy to read simple and powerfull..adatran – Ada ported staight from fortran. Ugly..adac – Ada ported from C. Ugly hard..The original code always makes good sense for the language it was written in.  Stop worrying about lines of code, length of variable names etc.. Is the code readable maintainable is a much more important..This blog article was pure genius!.I often have to switch between the java and the python style. Sometimes in the process idioms get mixed in my mind and I suffer more than necessary. Having it written out instead of just trusting intuition while doing makes the issue clearer and decisions easier. Somebody should put up a website with rules of thumb to convert java to python and the reverse (python->java)..Another point I’m tempted to add is: consider monkey-patching before subclassing. Suppose you are using a standard library and the standard library doesn’t have all the functionality, it is possible to replace the code or add more calls to the original class. This can speed up prototyping, since you get to experiment without subclassing..re:”””Just because some people aren’t experts in one language or another doesn’t mean one language is better than the other.”””.Of course not.  We all know that Python is the better language, anyway.  😉.More seriously, I would say that “better” isn’t very specific as to what criterion is being used for judgment.  Criteria like “more powerful” are much more easily measured.  For example, it’s trivial to illustrate numerous ways in which Python is a more powerful language than Java — and of course I already did that..But “more powerful” doesn’t necessarily translate to “better”, since Lisp is “more powerful” than Python in an objective sense, but you probably won’t catch me writing Lisp code any time soon.  (In fact my last Lisp usage was probably writing Emacs macros, back about a decade ago.).re:Python/Java phrasebooks.See ., for a wiki where you can perhaps add your own ideas..re:monkeypatching.I consider monkeypatching a strategy of last-resort, because it doesn’t scale.  If other modules monkeypatch the same thing, now where are you?  I believe the long-term replacement for monkeypatching is built-in support for generic functions, which allow third parties to cleanly add additional processing cases to an existing function..I feel your pain. In particular I have to second your statements about XML (the other commenters neglected their duties here:-). Yeah, XML… While traditional compiler tools remained obscure and idiosyncratic despite of man-centuries of R&D, XML finally brought language engineering.to the masses. Never was creating your own domain-specific language and getting a parser for it so easy! (Although habitual grumblers will argue that all these XML-based languages look the same and can neither be read nor written by humans with any residual self esteem…) But what _really_ tends to be forgotten in all this glory is the fact that language implementation does not end at parsing. You can parse? Fine, now get ready for real thing: implement your language’s semantics! We wish you good luck not only in reinventing all the standard wheels of control flow and data structures (add a modern type system in your       copious free time), but also in getting your implementation as mature and trusted as the one of.any established programming language, especially the OSS ones. Your language does not need any bells and whistles? It will, two years from now (given you still have users they’ll demand them ever more loudly), or your language will be dead and forgotten. Don’t forget to add good error handling and make your implementation interoperable with at least those parts of the rest of the world essential to your application domain..Unconvinced readers might have a look at the evolution of Ant, the Java build tool. The Ant spec language started as a saner, XML-based version of make (no more tab-induced trouble) and now approaches the complexity of a full-blown scripting language – XML-based, unreadable, and not reusing a single line of code from all the mature scripting language implementations out there. Ant users and devlopers eventually figured out ways to save the hassle and just import Jython or Groovy scripts instead recently..In a blog entry that seems to have expired meanwhile,  James Duncan Davidson explained that he would base Ant on a real, established language like Jython would he design it again. There’s still a link left at .which page in its entirety grinds the same axe..I also liked your reference-in-passing about the Lispers’ special relationship towards XML. Erik Naggum’s XML-related rants on comp.lang.lisp are real classics (independent from other aspects of his personality as apparent from his postings). Take this for an appetizer: “Structure is _nothing_ if it is all you got.  Skeletons _spook_ people if they try to walk around on their own.  I really wonder why XML does not.”.You can find that Ant article in the Wayback machine, ...As a single Pythonista in a sea of Java developers, I currently write both Java and Python code.  However, I find that the best way to write Java code is to sketch it out in Python first then translate to Java.  That way I get the structure and design right before I formalize.  The success I’ve had with this approach leads me to believe that Python is to Java as C is to assembly code..Hello,. Can you show an example of when to many if thens should be turned into a hash  lookup? Or can you provide a pointer to a good reference. I often have a lot of if elifs in my programs and I would like to make them easier to manage….What are your if-then’s checking?  Type?  Value?  Range?  Strings?  Integers?  What do the various branches actually do?  The appropriate mechanism for testing will differ accordingly..In other words, give *me* an example of one of your big conditional blocks, and I’ll suggest alternatives..Another thing I notice with Java is the “Bundle it up in an object” attitude. In Python, sometimes one can work quite effectively without putting _everything_ in objects..For example, I frequently find it useful to mix functional-style code (written using functions that return the results of list comprehensions) with more conventional procedural OO code. Forcing myself to pick either one model or the other would cost me time, and result in buggier, less readable code..As someone who _loathed_ functional programming when first exposed to it, I’ve found it’s grown on me a lot. Not being forced to use purely functional methods for problems that were poorly suited to a functional approach helps. The freedom Python gives me to choose a basic procedural, OO, or functional approach as the problem warrants is the main reason I’m finding I like it so much, though..If you do get into functional-style Python, please keep one thing in mind. Nesting list comprehensions is rarely cool – it’s usually much more readable and maintanable to split the inner comprehension into a new function..Can’t-wait-for-generator-expressions ‘ly yours 😉.Craig Ringer.I’m not sure why people are asking for dict-as-switch examples, but here are some cases.  If you are using the if-elif-else to set some variables put all the data up front in a hash. Here is an example for a text object that can take a point size (int) or a name as the ‘size’ argument..size_to_point = {‘small’:7, ‘normal’:9, ‘large’:12,}.try:.  point_size = size_to_point[size].except KeyError: # must be an int.  point_size = size.If the if-elif-else is doing different operations on the data make a function lookup table like you would in C..color_ops = {‘blur’:imageops.blur, ‘dodge’: mydodge,}.You can mix these two together by making the value of the dictionary a tuple.  In the data case this can be handy for setting more than one variable..(color, size, font) = font_desc[font_name].The formatting on that sucks, but I already typed it all in and blogger doesn’t tell me what tags are allowed..There is a nicer way to do the transform:.size_to_point = {‘small’:7, ‘normal’:9, ‘large’:12,0:9}.point_size = size_to_point.get(size,size).dict.get is always a win over using try/except (note that I added a case for passing in 0 too.).What makes you think this code would be acceptable in Java?  It’s *not* okay on the teams I work on to write a bunch of duplicate code just because you’re using Java.  This is not just a Python thing, it’s a writing code well thing.  Anonymous classes can do much the same thing as closures, and well-written Java code is easier to read than XML..Also, I think you left out the most important tip:  If your team’s programmers are more comfortable in Java, *stick to Java*.  Python has some nice language features, but by switching you’re giving up a lot too..In Java, alas, the cure for duplicated code can be worse than the disease.  For example, you replace duplication of the code with duplication of code to create and call the pseudo-closure..Not only that, but there are so many places where lots and lots of typing is required in Java, to the extent that one becomes numbed to seeing large masses of similar code.  The problem is that Java developers don’t *see* that this code is duplicative, because it’s stuff that there’s no practical way in Java to NOT duplicate..However, that same code, translated to Python, will often immediately suggest ways to restructure for less duplication.  For example, the existence of keyword arguments and default values in Python makes it possible to put even complex alternate behaviors into a single function.  The corresponding solution in Java involves lots of little methods that call each other or duplicate pieces of the behavior, assuming you think to do it in the first place..Anyway, the kind of duplication I was talking about in the post was duplication that’s systemic and idiomatic to Java as a language, because it’s not practical to remove the duplication due to language limitations.  I wasn’t talking about your everyday non-DRY sorts of code duplication..Ok, I understand the first paragraph, and I can accept that your list of tips is valid and reasonable, but try as I might, I can’t make the leap from A to B — it would be helpful if you could illustrate these paradigm errors directly with examples from the wxPython code so we can see directly how each applies, and observe the difference in performance once the code is fixed..I’d want to get permission from the authors of that code before I did that.  In any case, the biggest performance boost would be in getting rid of the XML processing, which is directly responsible for at least half of its startup time.  But that’s not a quick one-line change, and there’s no way the patch would fit in a comment here..One of the other major performance drains in the app is actually its use of a __getattr__ hook, instead of using descriptors.  That too is a significant refactoring.  About the only refactoring pattern that would easily fit here would be the duplicated code thing, which I’ve already illustrated here in a ...The remarks concerning XML seem to address a quite small slot of XMLs scope only and I’m not even sure, which slot. At least the hint to use Python instead points vaguely into “active content” direction..As a data exchange format between different languages or for a data store prepared for applications not yet written I see no easy substitution (by a pickled instance or something similar)..“””The remarks concerning XML seem to address a quite small slot of XMLs scope only and I’m not even sure, which slot.”””.Does this clear it up:.“If you’re not implementing an existing XML standard for interoperability reasons, creating some kind of import/export format, or creating some kind of XML editor or processing tool, then Just Don’t Do It.”.These “slots” as you call them, are the main places where implementing an XML-based format is sensible.  There are other times and places where an XML format is also useful, but they’re fairly uncommon.  Mainly, they amount to places where you actually need some kind of *markup*, as opposed to just a data format..“””As a data exchange format between different languages”””.i.e., an “import/export format”.“””or for a data store prepared for applications not yet written”””.You’ll have a lot better chance at decent performance and usability with a relational database.  Unless you’re talking about a way to specify data to go into the database, in which case we’re back to import/export format..Thanks so much! I myself am a person coming to python after writing lots of java. i found the getter and setter part especially enlightening..rahul garg.I bet you are talking about Chandler 😉.Very Nicely Said. I like this blogpost. I am a newbie who is just trying to learn Python for implementing a domain specific language that will check for performance asserions made in the language..I also gained some ammo against people who were cribbing against Python in my .-Paddy.This comment has been removed by a blog administrator..This comment has been removed by a blog administrator..Hi Philip,.this post is cool, but why Python? You are talking about simplicity, but have you ever tried to code in Ruby?.Szymon Drejewicz.P.S. For example, in Ruby tinyp2p takes 6 lines of code, not 15 🙂 Most of expressions in Ruby is much cleaner than in Python, believe me..One thing that struck me (as a Java developer) is that I found the comments about XML to be very applicable to Java development.  I too have seen the pain that results from developers saying, “We’ll use XML!  It’ll be easy!”.Can someone elaborate on the differences, or is this an example where we actually share the pain?.I develop applications in both Python and Java.  The Java way of doing things makes you jump though hoops to do simple things.  Python’s approach is much more streamlined and intuitive for most operations.  .Java is also screwy in nature since the designers, in their infinite wisdom said “operator overloading is bad” and then they created the String class which overloads the “+” operator!  Wait a second, why can’t I overload the “+” operator in my Java classes?  If String can do it, why can’t MyString or MyOtherClass overload operators?.Then they created crippled classes that wrap primitive types like Integer, Long, etc… Yet these classes have no useful methods, heck, you can’t even change their value once you create them.  A true Integer class would have allowed you to “add”, “subtract”, etc.. but not in Java.  You need to do so at the primitive level yet you need the Integer objects if you want to use them in a hashtable, list, etc..  .Java:.// store and retrieve an integer in a list.List l = new ArrayList();.l.add ( new Integer(123) );.int i = l.get(0).intValue();.Python:.# store and retieve an integer in a list.l = [123].i = l[0].Java forces you to write classes to do anything yet they provide useless Integer classes.  That is, say you want to output “Hello World” then you need to create a class and a method that does so.  That’s the thing, “not everything *is* an object”  so why does everything need to be a class?  Obviously, the primitives aren’t objects so why can’t I write functions that aren’t member functions?  Other OOP languages don’t force you to do everything at the object level (eg. C++, Python, etc)..Common operations in most languages are to coerce (or cast) values from one type to another.  For instance, you have a string “1234” but want the value as an integer, so what do you do….Java:  int i = Integer.parseInt(“1234”);.Python: i = int(“1234”).Also, the reverse, you have an integer 9876 and you want it as a string:.Java: String s = “”+9876;.-or-.Java: String s = String.valueOf(9876);.Python: s = str(9876);.So you want to compare 2 strings for equality?.Java: .String s1 = “string 1”;.String s2 = “string 2”;.if (s1.equals(s2)) { // do something }.Python:.s1 = “string 1”.s2 = “string 2”.if s1 == s2: # do something.Why did the java designers overload ‘+’ but not equality?  How often do you really want to compare the identity of two strings rather than the value of them?.Ahhh, in just a few examples, I’ve demonstrated how much more elegant Python is than Java…  You want to overload operators you can.  You want to add two integer objects, you can.  You want to output “Hello World” you can do so in a class, in a function or inline.  It’s your choice. .That’s the thing about coding Python, it’s your choice.  Why let the language designers box you into a corner as you jump through hoops to do simple things.  If you have to do so for the simple things just imagine what death defying acts you’ll need to perform in order to do complex things!.Python Rocks >.Actually, you should not convert an integer to a string through the str() construct, it’s horribly ineficient..Replacing “s = str(9876)” with “s = `9876`” shows a noticeable increase in efficiency: on my box, 10000000 runs of the conversion operation (“str(9876)” or “`9876`”) yields 12.26 seconds for the first construct, and 7.35 for the second one, 40% faster..And I find it much more readable to boot.It’s even worse:.// store and retrieve an integer in a list.List l = new ArrayList();.l.add ( new Integer(123) );.int i = l.((Integer) get(0)).intValue();.The get() method returns Object, not Integer, so you need to downcast it before you can call intValue.  Eyew..Come on, let’s stay serious..Java:.int l[] = new int[1]; // ok one more line to declare.l[0] = 123;.int i = l[0];.// say no more.Just wanted to make a reply to the person who was talking about ANT.  While I agree that XML wasn’t necessarily the greatest language in the world to use to describe the processes in ANT.  The reason ANT is so popular is because it has an incredibly powerful set of libraries that make it trivial to do very complex operations (especially file operations).  I wrote a cron-like application that handles hundreds of tasks a day using Ant as a core and it saved me vast amounts of time..It also integrates very well with IDE’s, tools, and other such fun uses.  This is probably Java’s greatest strength.  As a language its pretty poor (mainly because Sun’s philosophy seems to be anything that could have been done correct on the first try should instead be hacked together and fixed later), but there are so many libraries and tools to do useful things in java..I’m actually about to switch to using python from java, but I’m definitely going to miss things like Ant (which I may end up trying to use anyway) and Intellij Idea.  Are there good programming tools like these available in Python?  Which ones should I use?.tammo, try this….int l[] = new int[] { 1 };.int i = l[0];.But of course the only operation you get for free on a primitive array is length, so Python’s list is more useful..I’ve seen the question asked from time to time: how do you unit test a wxPython application?Well, I don’t have a silver bullet, but it seems to me that the new SWIG wrapping of recent wxPython versions allows a new possibility: mocking the entire....The peak.running.options module is finished in CVS, and there’s now a nice Options How-to available, courtesy of myself and the doctest module.
