        "In this article, we explore the differences, similarities, and use cases for Python and Go, two of the most popular programming languages in the world. Start with this quick comparison of the two, then see how they stack up when it comes to readability, speed, ease of learning, and more..Python and Go are different, generally serving different purposes. Python is the primary language among ., where Go is the language for server-side commands. Go is the language to use to run software. It is the faster language, performing at Java and C++ speeds..Python is the language to use for readable, shareable code—hence the large community around it..Technically, Go is a procedural, functional language built for speed, and Python is an object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural language. Go supports concurrency, the ability of an algorithm to run its steps out of order, and Python doesn’t..In short, if you are working with data and your audience is people, use Python. If you are working with servers, use Go..Python was first released in 1991. Designed by Guido van Rossum, Python’s design philosophy centered around code readability..Python is an interpreted, high-level, general purpose programming language. It is object-oriented..With its design focused on readability, the Python community will grade each other’s code based on how Pythonic the code is. Because of its readability, Python is great for:.Short for Golang, Go was first designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007..Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language that is open-sourced and maintained by Google. Go is a part of the C-Family programming languages, and it uses a garbage collector to handle memory leaks. When designing Golang, its creators wanted to improve on what already existed, and one of those elements was readability..The base standard for unreadable code is Java and C++. Both Python and Go wished to improve upon them. There are a few changes Go makes. Similar to Python, Go does away with:.If you’re familiar with C-Level languages, then this should look pretty familiar:.Go example:.Returns: 7 10.Python example (Non-Pythonic):.Python example (Pythonic):.Returns:.Most IDEs will help spot errors in Python code as it is written. Unlike Python, Go has no error handling. It is built for people who already know how to code. While easier to read and type, its simplicity comes at a cost of leaving greater room for errors in the code, meaning there will be more time spent debugging the code..When it comes to speed, Go is fast. Go was meant to be fast, whereas that is not Python’s sole aim. On most benchmarks, Go beats Python by far. ., which is widely considered to be significantly faster than Python. If it comes down to needing a program to load software quickly, Go is the way to Go..To demonstrate, here’s what . said about Go:.The answer: Go is just that fast. (Mostly due to static versus dynamic types and compiling). Here are some examples from .:.Python is 16 years older than Go, so a much larger community has built up around it. With that community, it has a huge amount of support on Stack Overflow geared towards all types: beginners, lessons, tutorials and how-to’s, and, ultimately, libraries.

Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab notebooks allow Python users to read and execute code in a very interactive, reading and writing experience..Sharing and showing these kinds of charts in Go would be very difficult to get up and running..Programming languages are being designed better and smarter. The readability of any code makes it easy to learn. In the coding world, it’s accepted truth that if you learn one language, you can learn any other—you just need to dive in..Discussing the differences matters only to the nit-picky and those who can already read and write in one language. These differences aren’t significant in a way that should concern a person’s choice to get started in programming. Instead, these differences matter only when choosing which language is best to execute a function..Go and Python are both easy to use and to learn. Go is really fast. Python has a ton of community support..Right now, in Go’s development, Go is mostly used for server-side applications. Python is the data scientist’s go-to language, and likely will be for a long time to come. All the ML library developers are putting their time into developing libraries for Python. Go may get there in time, but for now, there is room for two languages in the programmer’s toolkit.

Early this year, we switched . primary programming language from Python to Go. This post will explain some of the reasons why we decided to leave Python behind and make the switch to Go. Thanks to . for translating ...Go is fast! Go is extremely fast. The performance is similar to that of Java or C++. For our use case, Go is typically 40 times faster than Python. Here’s a small benchmark game comparing ...For many applications, the programming language is simply the glue between the app and the database. The performance of the language itself usually doesn’t matter much. Stream, however, is an . powering a . and . for 700 companies and more than 500 million end users. We’ve been optimizing Cassandra, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc. for years, but eventually, you reach the limits of the language you’re using. Python is a great language but its performance is pretty sluggish for use cases such as serialization/deserialization, ranking and aggregation. We frequently ran into performance issues where Cassandra would take 1ms to retrieve the data and Python would spend the next 10ms turning it into objects..Have a look at this little snippet of Go code from the .. (This is a great tutorial and a good starting point to pick up a bit of Go.).If you’re new to Go, there’s not much that will surprise you when reading that little code snippet. It showcases multiple assignments, data structures, pointers, formatting and a built-in HTTP library. When I first started programming I always loved using Python’s more advanced features. Python allows you to get pretty creative with the code you’re writing. For instance, you can:.These features are fun to play around with but, as most programmers will agree, they often make the code harder to understand when reading someone else’s work. Go forces you to stick to the basics. This makes it very easy to read anyone’s code and immediately understand what’s going on. . .As a language, Go tries to keep things simple. It doesn’t introduce many new concepts. The focus is on creating a simple language that is incredibly fast and easy to work with. The only area where it does get innovative is goroutines and channels. (To be 100% correct the concept of . started in 1977, so this innovation is more of a new approach to an old idea.) Goroutines are Go’s lightweight approach to threading, and channels are the preferred way to communicate between goroutines. Goroutines are very cheap to create and only take a few KBs of additional memory. Because Goroutines are so light, it is possible to have hundreds or even thousands of them running at the same time. You can communicate between goroutines using channels. The Go runtime handles all the complexity. The goroutines and channel-based approach to concurrency makes it very easy to use all available CPU cores and handle concurrent IO - all without complicating development. Compared to Python/Java, running a function on a goroutine requires minimal boilerplate code. You simply prepend the function call with the keyword “go”:. Go’s approach to concurrency is very easy to work with. It’s an interesting approach compared to Node where the developer has to pay close attention to how asynchronous code is handled. Another great aspect of concurrency in Go is the .. This makes it easy to figure out if there are any race conditions within your asynchronous code..Knock knock Race condition Who's there?.— I Am Devloper (@iamdevloper) .Here are a few good resources to get started with Go and channels:.Our largest micro service written in Go currently takes 4 seconds to compile. Go’s fast compile times are a major productivity win compared to languages like Java and C++ which are famous for sluggish compilation speed. I like sword fighting, but it’s even nicer to get things done while I still remember what the code is supposed to do:.First of all, let’s start with the obvious: there are not as many Go developers compared to older languages like C++ and Java. According to ., . of developers know Java, . know C++ and only . know Go. . shows a .: Go is more widely used than languages such as Erlang, Scala and Elixir, but less popular than Java and C++. Fortunately, Go is a very simple and easy to learn language. It provides the basic features you need and nothing else. The new concepts it introduces are the “.” statement and built-in management of concurrency with “go routines” and channels. (For the purists: Go isn’t the first language to implement these concepts, just the first to make them popular.) Any Python, Elixir, C++, Scala or Java dev that joins a team can be effective at Go within a month because of its simplicity. We’ve found it easier to build a team of Go developers compared to many other languages. If you’re hiring people in competitive ecosystems like . this is an important benefit..For a team of our size (~20 people) the ecosystem matters. You simply can’t create value for your customers if you have to reinvent every little piece of functionality. Go has great support for the tools we use. Solid libraries were already available for Redis, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Template parsing, Task scheduling, Expression parsing and RocksDB. Go’s ecosystem is a major win compared to other newer languages like Rust or Elixir. It’s of course not as good as languages like Java, Python or Node, but it’s solid and for many basic needs you’ll find high-quality packages already available..Let’s start with what is Gofmt? And no, it’s not a swear word. Gofmt is an awesome command line utility, built into the Go compiler for formatting your code. In terms of functionality it's very similar to Python’s autopep8. While the show Silicon Valley portrays otherwise, most of us don’t really like to argue about tabs vs spaces. It’s important that formatting is consistent, but the actual formatting standard doesn’t really matter all that much. Gofmt avoids all of this discussion by having one official way to format your code..Go has first-class support for protocol buffers and gRPC. These two tools work very well together for building microservices which need to communicate via RPC. You only need to write a manifest where you define the RPC calls that can be made and what arguments they take. Both server and client code are then automatically generated from this manifest. This resulting code is both fast, has a very small network footprint and is easy to use. From the same manifest, you can generate client code for many different languages even, such as C++, Java, Python and Ruby. So, no more ambiguous REST endpoints for internal traffic, that you have to write almost the same client and server code for every time. ..Go doesn’t have a single dominant framework like Rails for Ruby, Django for Python or Laravel for PHP. This is a topic of heated debate within the Go community, as many people advocate that you shouldn’t use a framework to begin with. I totally agree that this is true for some use cases. However, if someone wants to build a simple CRUD API they will have a much easier time with Django/DJRF, Rails Laravel or .. . as the comments pointed out there are several projects that provide a framework for Go. ., ., ., . and . seem to be the leading contenders. For Stream's use case we prefer to not use a framework. However for many new projects that are looking to provide a simple CRUD API the lack of a dominant framework will be a serious disadvantage..Go handles errors by simply returning an error from a function and expecting your calling code to handle the error (or to return it up the calling stack). While this approach works, it’s easy to lose scope of what went wrong to ensure you can provide a meaningful error to your users. The . solves this problem by allowing you to add context and a stack trace to your errors. Another issue is that it’s easy to forget to handle an error by accident. Static analysis tools like errcheck and megacheck are handy to avoid making these mistakes. While these workarounds work well it doesn’t feel quite right. You’d expect proper error handling to be supported by the language.. Go’s package management is by no means perfect. By default, it doesn’t have a way to specify a specific version of a dependency and there’s no way to create reproducible builds. Python, Node and Ruby all have better systems for package management. However, with the right tools, Go’s package management works quite well. You can use . to manage your dependencies to allow specifying and pinning versions. Apart from that, we’ve contributed an open-source tool called . which makes it easier to work on multiple projects written in Go.. One interesting experiment we conducted was taking our . functionality in Python and rewriting it in Go. Have a look at this example of a ranking method:.Both the Python and Go code need to do the following to support this ranking method:.Developing the Python version of the ranking code took roughly 3 days. That includes writing the code, unit tests and documentation. Next, we’ve spent approximately 2 weeks optimizing the code. One of the optimizations was translating the score expression (simple_gauss(time)*popularity) into an .. We also implemented caching logic which pre-computed the score for certain times in the future. In contrast, developing the Go version of this code took roughly 4 days. The performance didn’t require any further optimization. So while the initial bit of development was faster in Python, the Go based version ultimately required substantially less work from our team. As an added benefit, the Go code performed roughly 40 times faster than our highly-optimized Python code. Now, this is just a single example of the performance gains we’ve experienced by switching to Go. It is, of course, comparing apples to oranges:.Your mileage will vary. Some other components of our system took substantially more time to build in Go compared to Python. As a general trend, we see that . Go code takes slightly more effort. However, we spend much less time . the code for performance..Another language we evaluated is .. Elixir is built on top of the Erlang virtual machine. It’s a fascinating language and we considered it since one of our team members has a ton of experience with Erlang. For our use cases, we noticed that Go’s raw performance is much better. Both Go and Elixir will do a great job serving thousands of concurrent requests. However, if you look at individual request performance, Go is substantially faster for our use case. Another reason why we chose Go over Elixir was the ecosystem. For the components we required, Go had more mature libraries whereas, in many cases, the Elixir libraries weren’t ready for production usage. It’s also harder to train/find developers to work with Elixir. These reasons tipped the balance in favor of Go. The Phoenix framework for Elixir looks awesome though and is definitely worth a look..Go is a very performant language with great support for concurrency. It is almost as fast as languages like C++ and Java. While it does take a bit more time to build things using Go compared to Python or Ruby, you’ll save a ton of time spent on optimizing the code. We have a small development team at . powering feeds and . for over 500 million end users. Go’s combination of a ., . for new developers, ., . for concurrency and a . make it a great choice. Stream still leverages Python for our dashboard, site and machine learning for .. We won’t be saying goodbye to Python anytime soon, but going forward all performance-intensive code will be written in Go. Our new . is also written entirely in Go.

        "4 October 2021.26 minutes. . reading.Python is one of the most popular programming languages. 52% of almost . claim that they used this language in the last year. What’s even more interesting, .. Go, despite being less than half the age of Python, doesn’t lag  behind - it is in the top 5 programming languages that developers are planning to migrate to or adopt. .In this article, you can find the following information:.To be specific, in this article we’re focusing on CPython (the original Python implementation). So, please bear in mind that (for the purposes of this article) we’re using CPython implementation as our basis for comparison..Python is described as:.Python combines dynamic typing (each variable is determined only during runtime) and dynamic binding -  the variable is bound to a type, instead of being specified by a declaration statement. Python has a lot of built-in data structures, and it is a general-purpose language, so it isn’t specialized for any specific problems. .We could take . as being the closest to the language specification. You can find there the description of the syntax and the often-used semantics. .Is Golang interpreted or procedural like Python? Let’s check. .If we’re talking about ., it is necessary to mention that this language is:.Go has both the features of statically typed languages (high performance, type safety) and dynamically typed/interpreted languages (conciseness, expressiveness, better readability)..An example of Go’s shorthand variable declaration type safety and conciseness is presented in the table:.Table 1.  Variable declaration type safety and conciseness.In this scenario, we declare an integer variable and later we try to assign a boolean value to it. As we can see, Go and C++ prevent changing the variable’s type. However, Go’s variable declaration doesn’t require an explicit type statement - it is inferred from the assigned value type..Here we mentioned C++ only as an example in our table. If you are curious how ., where we covered the main aspects. .To dig deeper into the ., you can click ., and get answers for every question which comes to mind. .But how exactly are these programming languages different from each other during day-to-day use? .Go and Python cannot be simply compared to each other based on their features alone, such as whether they are high-level programming languages, etc. However, there are crucial aspects of both programming languages which we can compare: readability, speed, error management, libraries, concurrency and community. Taken together, these will create a more precise description of both Go and Python. .Readability indicates whether a specific programming language is easy to understand, read and learn. Usually, if the language has a higher readability level that means it will be easier to debug and you'll be able to write an application faster. .The syntax is the foundation if we’re talking about readability. Synta is all about using specific words in a predefined order to create commands understandable by the computer. Are there any differences in these programming languages’ syntax? Let’s check. .Syntax is one of the aspects that influences readability level. Let’s look at how static and dynamic typing can change the readability for better or worse.  .In Python, as a dynamic language, not every function is documented. That sometimes forces you to dig deeper into implementation, or alas, you will have to guess what input parameters are expected. Go, as a statically typed language, hands everything to you in regard to input type. Python syntax is quite dense, but uses a lot of English words. That makes it more understandable and easier. One of the Python . says: “There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.” With this mantra in mind, the newly-created syntax is possibly the easiest and most consistent. Nevertheless, you have to keep track - Python syntax changes with each new version of the language. .One of the Go programming language’s strengths is its minimal syntax - it has stayed almost the same, without any great changes in recent years. Thanks to that you have a guarantee that applications written in the older Go language version will still work. That means developers haven’t had to learn new paradigms or syntax. What’s more, there is only one standard code format. .Everything from the above indicates Go’s strength, until you want to write code that isn’t strictly based on the syntax. The Go programming language doesn’t leave you a choice - you have to be loyal to gofmt. Python gives you a helping hand - .. PEP 8 is a guide full of conventions to extend and enrich the standard Python library and is considered a formatting standard for Python projects. .To properly compare the speed of these languages, a few . were chosen to show how fast Go and Python can resolve them. .As you can see, only in one case was Python faster than Go. What, as in the n-body case, makes Go 89 times faster than Python? This isn’t an isolated example - in Fannkuch-redux, Go is almost 43 times faster. The main reason why the difference is so glaring is the fact that .. The Go programming language also has one more advantage: Goroutines. These lightweight threads need less RAM and are managed by Go runtime. In comparison to traditional threads (as in Python) Goroutines utilize less resources. What’s more, multithreading in Python couldn’t be taken literally - Python programs are single-threaded with the possibility to add concurrent routines. .But speed isn’t the only important aspect when creating an application. Exception handling can be a critical factor when choosing the programming language that is best-suited to your needs. .To be specific, we’re thinking about exceptions. An exception is anything anomalous which demands special/different processing. They are not caused by errors in syntax. Handling exceptions guarantees that the program flow isn’t interrupted when an error occurs. .How do the Python and Go programming languages deal with exceptions? .In Python, you can handle exceptions with three statements: .Statements between try and except all together create a try clause. .There are a few possible scenarios when you execute a try clause: .The finally statement is executed in any event. This is only a cursory explanation of how exceptions are handled in Python - on their ., you can find a more complex tutorial. .Digging into this topic deeper, you can also come across a raise statement. This statement helps in raising the exception - it is simply being forced to occur. .But you have to be aware that you should use this statement only in emergency situations. This isn’t a solution to control program flow. .What does the exception handling process look like in Go? Keep reading to find out. .Go, similarly to Python, provides three statements: .The first statement enables putting the execution of a function on hold. Panic arises during runtime if an unexpected condition occurs during execution. If that happens, the program starts “panicking”. Recover (as name suggests) is a function that recovers from a panicking goroutine. In standard execution, a call to recover will return nil and have no other effect. You have to use it inside deferred functions. .Read the full blogpost about . functions. .What also might interest you is the fact that .. What makes the code “smelly”? Everything in the source code of a program possibly signals a deeper problem..The exception handling processes in both programming languages are superficially similar. If you take a closer look, you’ll see the differences. In the Go language, you freeze the function in some way, and the exception occurs as a panic. Python provides you with more complex solutions with different potential endings, despite the situation. .In Go, the usual error handling leverages multi-value returns. If any of returned values complies with the error interface it should be checked for the existence of an error. Consider the following scenario:.In this scenario, we have a function greet which takes a name and returns a greeting. In the case of an empty name it fails and returns an error. The first call will result in printing \"name is empty\" and the second one will print \"Hello Jimmy\". This is a simple example, but it shows the main idea of multi-value returns with errors. With this pattern, any developer using a function is aware of whether the function can result in an error just by looking at its signature. With the panic/recover mechanism, anyone wanting to use the function would need to inspect the underlying implementation..Additionally, any error should be handled only once. This means that any time an error happens it should be either logged, passed on, stored, or handled in place. Handling an error this way simplifies the flow and makes code behavior more predictable since ultimately the error is handled in a single place without any side effects occurring somewhere deep in the code..One of the most popular complaints about Go (especially from newcomers) is the \"if err != nil {...}\" pattern. Many say that it clouds the code and makes it difficult to read. However, there are  patterns (such as one-line ifs) that can simplify the \"if err != nil {...}\" waves. Here is Rob Pike's (one of Go’s creators) take on error handling, which also addresses this issue - ...Dependency is a relationship between two components where the behavior or implementation of one is strongly dependent on the other. In practice, .. One example is integrating libraries and packages into applications. How do Go and Python handle dependency management for the user? .Python provides a few tools for dependency management. Choosing one of them, you should bear in mind that Python is widely used in various applications, and specific tools are better-suited to certain kinds of project; as briefly described below: .The Go creators proposed modules (modules equals external packages) as a solution for dependency management. . is supported by Go tools like pkg.go.dev to search for needed packages. The . defines each module with its properties and dependencies (both on other modules and the version of Go programming language).  .Go offers a unified solution regardless of the version you’re using (so long as it’s newer than 1.11, but we’re sure that you haven’t used that for a long time). On the one hand, it could be taken as an advantage - you haven’t sought for and installed any additional tools. On the other hand, there is no one-size-fits-all solution in programming, and sometimes  lack of choices can be limiting. .Concurrency is the ability to execute multiple processes, seemingly at the same time. One of the advantages of this approach is saving time, which is not the case when you’re waiting for one task to complete before the next. ., but provides some solutions to achieve concurrency, like: . Goroutines and channels are the greatest helpers: .Both languages offer solutions to manage concurrency. But in this battle, the Go programming language wins - Goroutines and channels support it from the beginning, and the whole language was created with supporting concurrency in mind. .In this case, there are more similarities than differences. Both languages are supported by strong communities - well-development channels on GitHub (., .), blogs like . - with tons of useful tutorials - or . which is supported by the Go creators who themselves write some of the articles. .Active and large communities translate to complex, curated and regularly updated libraries and frameworks for both the Go language and Python. .Probably, the most reliable sources are the “awesome” pages: .It doesn’t matter whether you choose the Go language or Python, you can count on the community's support and a variety of sources for tips, tricks, and tutorials.  .It is also good to know about the weaknesses of the solutions you’re considering, to be aware of what could be a barrier during project development. .We all know there is no one solution that performs for everyone in every project. That’s why it is better to know the drawbacks beforehand and make a wise decision. While using Go, you should be ready for a lack of generics, and a simplicity that can sometimes be a limitation instead of a benefit. . You should be aware that this is not the best choice for mobile development, it’s not suitable for low-level programming, and is seen as limited for database access. .These are the general disadvantages of both programming languages. They are mentioned only superficially here and you might wonder why. The answer is really simple - the disadvantages are subjective and don't have to be a barrier or weakness for every project. So there is no reason to focus on them unduly. It is more helpful to focus on looking at which types of projects best suit each language..Of course, there is no one strict list of projects for which Python always works. However, in some cases its features can perform better than other languages. You can consider Python if your project involves: .At CodiLime, we benefited from Python during a project for our Internet Service Provider client. In this . we describe how we built a web application for network monitoring in heterogeneous environments. .Could the Go programming language be chosen for similar projects to Python? Knowing the differences between them, you might guess that the answer is probably no. And you’d be right. Below are a few examples when Go can meet project expectations better.  .Are you still hesitating to use Go in a project? We prepared an in-depth article on ., including Go use cases, and the benefits both for programmers and business, gathered for you. .Generally, Golang’s strengths are that it is lightweight and quick to compile, which can be useful in fields like: .In this . you can find more information about companies using Go. There are some big names, like Uber or PayPal - so the variety of industries is quite impressive. .To sum up, both Go and Python have their pros and cons - each one could perform better in different types of project. It is good to know their features and strengths - that is the reason why the idea of this simple guide to the main differences between these programming languages first arose. Hopefully, this will help you use Go or Python wisely in your next project - or to find a developer who knows your chosen language inside out and will take your project to the next level.",

As you come from .net I’d consider similar approach and be considering Java with SpringBoot as it makes Java faster and much more fun to code web servers.Elixir really has a good performance for the web (and in general).\nIts framework Phoenix for the web is a great tool, easy to install and to use, with features for websockets (and Pub/Sub) or LiveView to write reactive and real time app with only HTML (and Elixir) so basically everything is in one place.It can take some time to learn a few things in Elixir but I really think it's worth it, and it's very easy to go distributed and concurrent with Elixir. Also it's easier to code quickly with some features like the pattern matching or some operators like the pipe or the capture one.And in the case you need it you can still connect and interface Python and Elixir pretty quickly, and now Elixir has a lot of different frameworks : web, embedded or even neural networks now.Never went far with Go but I have some trouble with its syntax, I find it a bit messy.I don't have a lot of experience with the web with Python but I don't have a good experience with the little I did.Hey Vitor, You can use Node and Express JS to create a backend for your app. You can create REST APIS to connect your front end with the backend. It is a very simple and scalable solution for building backend web apps. .Judging your previous experience we will benefit from Golang in terms of portability and speed. If you want to go simplier use Python. If it's only scripts use Python..What stack is a cryptocurrency exchange built upon? For example let's see Binance's page of BTC/USDT market. The order data refreshes in milliseconds, graphs refreshes in milliseconds, orders are placed in ms and everything moves well dynamically. How are they able to achieve it? What front-end framework might they be using? What backend framework for this kind of data, framework for matching engine, database for such heavy loads?.For such a more realtime-focused, data-centered application like an exchange, it's not the frontend or backend that matter much. In fact for that, they can do away with any of the popular frameworks like React/Vue/Angular for the frontend and Go/Python for the backend. For example uniswap's frontend (although much simpler than binance) is built in React. The main interesting part here would be how they are able to handle updating data so quickly. In my opinion,  they might be heavily reliant on realtime processing systems like Kafka+Kafka Streams, Apache Flink or Apache Spark Stream or similar. For more processing heavy but not so real-time processing, they might be relying on OLAP and/or warehousing tools like Cassandra/Redshift. They could have also optimized few high frequent queries using NoSQL stores like mongodb (for persistance) and in-memory cache like Redis (for further perfomance boost to get millisecond latencies)..While these tools are a great start, you are going to need low latency, and extremely high bandwidth. I couldn't see this happening without you having pretty much your own datacenter at your disposal. While the post below gives some great options, it's extremely apache-biased. Not saying apache is bad, but there are other options to explore. My recommendation is a mix of services from AWS, azure.. Whatever cloud service you choose to go with. You'll definitely need a streaming service.. Either self-built or cloud provided, and a restful API for things that don't quite require the power of a stream. Then, as you scale, you'll start to realize that even the best stacks in the world have bottlenecks, and you'll want to employ use of some type of messaging queue..I'm making my university community web service with a team. (6 members myself included) .And we decided to use ., HTML, CSS (for sure, it's the basic of websites) but couldn't decide for the back end part. .There are tons of languages, tools, etc., but I'm really new to programming, so I'd like to get some help to figure out what tools we need. .So my question is this: are there any good examples of web community services we can mimic the tools or get an insight from them? .Since you're following Python, I would recomend using Django as your main back-end language. If you know Python it would be a great experience.\nDjango is well documented on their official website:\n.\nI would also use React for front-end as well. \nAlso this article is worth reading, I think progressive web app is something worth learning these days:\n.\nHope that helps :).Since your team is already using JavaScript, there's a great number of examples for backend services written with NodeJS. I'd recommend using Firebase, or any backend as a service (you can use that term to find alternatives), for setting up your backend as it is much easier for newer people to understand and lets you focus on your core application logic, and not provisioning servers, databases, etc..Since you're team is already using JavaScript, there are alot of examples and open source projects written with NodeJs, so I preffer this language in your backend application and also I am recommended using Mongo DB with It for saving data in it, and also for your frontend application I am recommanded using VueJs..Since you are already using JavaScript on the front end it would be easy to adopt the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack which s all javascript based making it easy to transfer knowledge with the backend and front end.Make it simple, most of projects doesnt need a AI, ML or big algorithms.\nIf your project just serving end users take it to the web ready compatible. (Javascript, .Net, PHP Laravel).Kindly I don't find any help that solve this mystery I need more help if it will happen.Hello, I am interested in learning how to program. I am a beginner, and  many articles saying I should go with . if I am new to programming. I considered . a long time ago, but for my career, I believe major programming languages should be better for me. I'm considering Python at this moment, but if you have other tools I should use, let me know..The language you choose is also dependant on the type of career / area of programming you wish to focus on: Web Based and mobile applicaitons I would lean towards Java,  PC Applications I tend to like C#, \n Embedded industry C, C++.my advice , you should answer me for this question, what do you like to work: web base or mobile native or cross platform. if you like web base you should choose PHP or ASP.net or Node.js or if you like mobile native you should decide Android or IOS platform and else if you like cross platfrom you should learn Flutter with dart language.\nthanks.Hey, 👋 .My name is Brayden. I’m currently a Frontend . Developer, striving to move into Fullstack so I can expand my knowledge. .For my main backend language, I am deciding between .. I’ve tried each of them out for about an hour and currently, I like Python and Rust the most. However, I’m not sure if I’m missing out on something!.If anyone has advice on these technologies, I’d love to hear it!.Thanks. .Rust is still in low demand. It's a great language but you'll have a hard time finding jobs. Go is the mix of both Rust and Python. Great language with modern features, fast, scalable, fun to write, and at the same time it has high demand (not as much as python)..Python on the other hand is a language that you can't go wrong with. Look around you and see what your job market prefers. If there isn't much difference to you personally, pick the one with more demand..All of these are solid options, however considering your expertise currently, I would probably suggest Node.JS considering your past experience with JS. However Python offers a similar development environment to JS in my opinion, and Go is a good sort of intermediate between Rust and Node.JS and Python. It's fast, but not as fast as Rust, and offers a development experience that combines C-styled languages (like Rust), and Python-y languages... So: Rust for the fastest, Node for familiarity, Python for ease of development, and Go for a good middle ground. I have used all in personal projects... If you use Go, I suggest a easy to use web server framework like Fiber..Rust is a challenging choice, but worth to be chosen. It has strong memory-safety and type-safety, this gives you no bother about those errors. However, static typing languages often slow our developing speed down in early stage. In that case, it's effective to write prototype in an easy language like Python, and rewrite it in a hard language. It's important not to be afraid to throw away first code you write..The other answers are excellent, but I want to be a bit of a contrarian and say you should learn Rust. While the number of jobs for it are (relatively) low(er), it is certainly expanding and you'd be surprised at which companies do use Rust (Discord, for example, is starting to move away from Golang to Rust!). .But the main reason is that learning Rust itself will teach you a lot about systems design (/backend) because of its borrow checker. You can try out a lot of ideas and make a lot mistakes and the borrow checker will always be there guide you to a better solution (thereby teaching you in the process). .Also, I wouldn't underestimated how important managing memory (and memory safety) is. While Golang is great in some ways, it doesn't protect you from pushing memory leaks into production. And eventually you'll come upon a scenario where you'll have to make your Python code run faster and the optimizations you'd have to do won't look pretty (or be very Pythontic). .And Rust is freakin fast! If you have Rust, you wouldn't need any other language for the backend (or any other systems level code). Check this blog post: .. Discord found that even after spending months optimizing Golang code it still wasn't fast enough. But unoptimized, first-draft Rust code was (is) faster by an order of magnitude! .Hi.I want to build a tool to check asset availability (video, images, etc.) from third-party vendors. These vendors have APIs. However, this process should run daily basis and update the database with the status. This is a kind of separate process. I need to know what will be the good approach and technology for this?.hi - I think this depends on how you want to provide the information to the user. \nIf you want to build a Wordpress-plugin: PHP\nIf you want to build your own website: Python+Django / PHP / JavaScript+Node.js\nAs Desktop application?.for what technologies you should use, this is depend on what technology do you prefer? your should think best structuing for your code because each API vendor has different to a nother one so it's better no merege code vendores  together.\nyour code must be using SOLID principle pattern and some design pattern such as Factory Pattern.The major advantage of Go is that you can run queries in parallel. Fire off a Go thread for each vendor and each thread can check the availability of assets from a specific vendor and update the database. Go supports hundreds of threads with ease..Hi, I would recommend Go because of strongly-typed nature which makes a developer more productive as it is less error prone compared to the other dynamic-typed language. Go also has cron-job library(powered by goroutines) that can help with your automated tasks..your decision depend on what language do you know. if you know php you can use laravel framework.I am technical support. I work daily with . / Exchange, Active directory. I would like to learn scripting and automation to make my life easier. I just started learning . but not really sure about the correct study path from where I can start. I am taking some courses on Udemy and YouTube. Is it enough? .My first foray into programming was with powershell and it continues to be an enormous help for me in my career (caveat being that I have primarily worked on windows boxes). That being said, PowerShell is a weird language that has some unique syntax and operators that don't translate well to other languages.  Python is weird too, but for other reasons (spacing!). I suspect you'll get more immediate benefit spending some time on Powershell since your working in an environment that fully supports the ps toolset. .As for learning, I read \"PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches\" and found that helpful. However, I think your course of study is sufficient.  Think the most return for the effort was just messing around in the powershell IDE on my local computer and working the Microsoft documentation. .Taking courses on Udemy and YouTube will be helpful I'm sure, but don't neglect the power of practice. If you work largely with Windows right now, pick powershell. Take opportunities to convert the knowledge you already have (example: unlocking an account in Active Directory or adding an email alias in Exchange) from a manual process to a powershell method. Sometimes that's a single cmdlet (Unlock-AdAccount) and sometimes it's a script..Once you have a good understanding of variables, the pipeline, and foreach loops, you'll be in a position to accelerate your learning. Looking up Microsoft docs is part of the process :).I would consider reading \"Powershell for sysadmins\" from No Starch Press. Start small with the ActiveDirectory and AzureAd modules. Start with read only operations like pulling AD Group Members into a variable and then pipe that variable into a .csv file with Export-CSV cmdlet. Once you feel more comfortable with the syntax, specific cmdlets, and piping data start looking at specific techniques like using hashtables (dictionaries) and globbing. From there you can begin to construct your own functions and modules. Just start small and don't let yourself get overwhelmed. .I am a beginner, and I am totally confused, which of these 3 languages to learn first. \n., ., or .. As my studies are going which of them will be easy to learn with studies that is, I can learn and do my studies also. Which one of them will be easily handled with my studies, and will be much much useful in future?.python is a good language to start for the beginner..Python is a great language to learn as a beginner. However, Go is really easy to learn as well and has a much more powerful standard library that will allow you to build very complex and powerful applications in the future. Go is becoming a standard in Cloud computing and concurrency. Both of which are very advanced but important. .I'd definitely start with Go. I know Python, Go and quite a few other languages..Rust is not easy to learn as a beginner..Python has way too many features to be called \"easy\" to learn. While it is very forgiving to beginner mistakes it feels like playing in a puddle of mud. It does not teach you clean programming at all. Unless of course you like messy..Go on the other hand is very easy to learn. As a professional you can learn the entire language in under 2 hours. I have already given the tour of Go (.) to complete beginners and they went through it very thoroughly and thereby knew the entire Go language in less than 5 days. While it is very easy to learn and very easy to read, it is quite strict on other things, guiding you to write clean code. For one it is a typed language and it is good to learn very early about types..Knowing the entire language is of course not all there is to know. There is the standard library and a lot of other libraries to get to know in every language. Also one has to learn patterns in every language, get experience on how to structure code, dig deeper into the language itself to understand its inner workings, etc. That takes years in every language..That being said, it depends very much on what you want to do with a language. If you want to go into ML and science you definitely need Python. If you want to go into cloud computing, distributed servers (which in my opinion any server should be nowadays), use Go. If you want to do systems level programming, e.g in hardware programming, use Rust..I have experience in all three languages, and you should learn python first. These are three different languages (read: tools) to solve different problems you may have. \nPython is a high level language you can use for writing cross-platform scripts, web servers, AI, websites (e.g. Django) and the list goes on. Python can be used for most programming tasks while being the easiest to learn of the three and probably the most productive as well. .A lot of tech companies start out with Python for their web services, but due to Pythons slow speed and the pain that comes with dynamically typed languages when the code base grows, switch to Go later on when they need to scale. Go is a systems language that thrives when used for high performance cloud/web or networking services. Go is used in performance critical networking situations such as Twitch's streaming services and Uber's geofence services. It's also very clean and simple syntax that makes it very easy to quickly understand what code does..Python is an interpreted language and Go is a garbage collected language, but Rust is a highly performant and reliable compiled programming language without the extra baggage of runtime memory management. Rust forces you to follow coding patterns that assure memory safety. This makes Rust a perfect fit for high performance algorithms, game engines or safety-critical systems, but would be overkill for web servers or scripts on modern hardware..If all you want is a gentle intro and have access to tools and libs that can help with your tasks, Python is the way to go. It's ecosystem is huge and the language is easy to pick up. However, if you are aiming to get into software industry, I'd highly recommend you also pick up another classic language like C++/C#/Java. It really helps you cement some CS & programming fundamentals and get more familiar with the concept of software design and software architecture. Not saying you cannot achieve good architecture in Python or Go, but traditionally you have more materials covering these classic OOP languages. And once you learn them, you can apply your knowledge to other languages and it helps you understand other languages faster..Rust is probably a bad choice for starting out. It is a low level language where garbage collection is not done automatically, and has to get you thinking about all the technical aspects. It is statically typed and compiled, so it's very strict with how you code.\n I do love Rust though, it's a nice language.\nGolang is also compiled and statically typed, but it aims to be for quick development, which makes it a better choice for starting out..Python though can be great for starting out and getting a hold on how to program. You don't need to worry about things such as types, garbage collection, or an overwhelming amount of data types. \nSince I'm a JavaScript fanboy I can't help but say another great popular choice to start is JavaScript 😁.If you start learning programming I'd suggest Python language. I have no experience with Go and Rust so I cannot give you advice for them..Python has the broadest reach as it's been around the longest; rust is much more difficult for a beginner to learn; I work with Go every day and it's probably the most productive general use language..Learn/start with C; don't rush after buzz words. Python is easy to learn but you would not get the underpinnings of memory and pointers, an important aspect of programming. .I'd choose python because with a good knowledge of python and it's libraries, you could do literally anything. Also it has a relatively simple structure, so it won't be tough for a beginner. .Later on if you wish to learn Rust and Go, please do by all means..Study, machine learning = Python |\nHigh performance computing, safety-oriented programming = Rust |\nBackend, feel productive with less runtime performance drawback = Go.Go and Python are going to be much easier to learn than Rust. The memory management for Rust is pretty hard to wrap your head around when you are first learning how to do basic things with the language. Get familiar with programming first, then learn Rust. .I agree with most of the other answers here. Python is the best choice because it is super user-friendly, has an easy syntax, and can do many complex things in relatively fewer lines. .While Rust is a more recent and a great language nonetheless, it is slightly more complicated as it involves compiling and the syntax isn't so great. .And Go is the not a great choice either. While it has a decent syntax, keep in mind that Go won't be of much use unless you plan on working in Google. Even if you want to learn it, you can do so later..I hope this helped you in making your decision, and welcome to the world of programming! I hope you enjoy..Python is the easiest of the languages to learn, and while the slowest in production, it will teach many of the basic fundamental concepts of programming, especially if you're not going to be doing anything low level or at a system level..Python is a great language to start programming with, there is an awesome python course on coursera by Dr. Charles Severance called Programming for everybody, check it out :).Python, because its the easiest to learn as a beginer. Its often called \"English without grammar\" because its terms and writing style is quite similar to English. Python also has a diverse range of applications like Web App, Desktop App, Data Science etc.Python is the best programming language for starting out as it is quite easy to learn, but it also is very powerful and you can do plenty with it. It will be useful for a long time. Python is my recommendation..Hi all,  I have been working on the development and automation of construction software using . and .. Recently I have started working on . python web framework and basic frontend for web development. I am really confused to choose between C# and Python to move forward in my career. Seeking your advice on these technologies and their future market value from a career perspective.\nThanks, .In my opinion, a modern developer should have deep knowledge about Object Oriented (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP). The programming language is something that must come later. Any good programmer should be able to switch from one programming language to another easily, if they follow OOP and FP. There are languages, though, that must absolutely be in the portfolio of a modern developer: Java, C#, Python and JavaScript. But be prepared to know also Scala, Kotlin, Swift, Go, Ruby, Rust and TypeScript..C# and Python are both great languages. With great communities, libraries, frameworks, opportunities. I think it will be the same in a near future..It’s matter of your likes, and your next jobs..Dot net core is a little faster on performance.\nPython more popular with dynamic types. Probably the most lovable language..It depends on your preferred career path, if you want to work in start-up/scale-up environments, you probably want to go with a language like Django for the rapid development (fast to production).\nOn the other hand, C# or Java would be better for building long term and large scaled applications, although, Django could certainly achieve this as well. \nI also want to second that it won't hurt to know both languages, pick your technologies wisely according to the use case, don't stick to a single technology stack. :).Hi, I'm just starting to learn code, and I stumbled upon this website. I think I should learn ., ., and . to begin with. I'm a quick learner so I am only worried about what would be more useful. Suppose my goal is to build an online clothing store or something. Then what languages would be best? I need advice. Please help me out. I'm 13 and just beginning and it's hard to understand when people use technical terms so please keep it simple. Thanks a lot..Go with Python. It's syntax is really simple and less verbose compare to others. You can use Python for basically anything like web dev, task automation, data science, data engineering, cybersecurity etc. At initial level, it's more important to get an understanding of programming fundamentals. Once you get conformable with coding in general, then you can explore other languages. .I would worry less about languages when you're first starting out. If you want to build an online store, then javascript is a great language that is used all over the web! Get comfortable with your first language, learn some computer science concepts and how to build things the right way, and then just work towards a goal and learn as you go! . is a great resource and it's completely free, everything you need to know to build a website is on that page if you have the drive to learn it. Best of luck to you!.Here's a neat roadmap too, in case you find yourself lost on what to learn next \n.I recommend JavaScript to build your first website, for both FrontEnd and BackEnd , even tho I am a BIG fan of C++ it is not well suited yet to create websites, and Python would be just as good for the BackEnd as JavaScript but having everything written in only one language will make your learning curve way easier, so it is easy to recommend JavaScript..Python is an easy and beginner-friendly language. As you've mentioned about Online Clothing store, you'll need to deal with the website part and you'll need Javascript to make the site accessible and functional. Javascript will be more easy to learn if you learn Python first, so you can just start with Python..Hello Rachel, as a fellow programmer, I am glad that you are planning on expanding your coding knowledge and skills..I recommend learning python first as it has a very simple syntax (syntax is how your code looks and how simple it is to type) and is also very user-friendly. Once you get to know how to code in python, you can use this thing called Flask. .If you are looking for simpler ways for making website without having to learn a lot of programming, you can learn HTML and CSS. These 2 will help you in making a basic and functional website. The catch is, from a career perspective, HTML won't get you far, as literally every programmer knows it. So it is best to use programming languages..I hope this gave you a clear understanding of the ways in which you can build websites. Wishing you the best of luck!.I have worked with all these a ton. I make ecommerce and enterprise apps now. The only one of these you need is JavaScript. You can use JS on the backend as Node.js in AWS Lambda. You will need HTML and CSS skills, as well as a database. I recommend MongoDB. Please forget about C++ until you built your first company. Python fits the same purpose as Node.js but is currently popular in the Data Science community so skip it until you have a LOT of customers..Hi,\nWhen saying that \"Suppose my goal is to build an online clothing store or something\", I would go for a ready to use platform like Wordpress. it will give you a fast jump into the online world. By using WP you'll have to catch on with PHP\\JQuery\nGoodluck.. \nPing me when store is ready, I might buy something.....Since you're new, I'd recommend Javascript and Python. With Javascript, just learn React and Node. And with Python, learn Django. With JavaScript, Node, React, Python, and Django; you can accomplish quite a lot for both frontend and backend.       .Python will be used in order to train machine learning models from our data.  We chose python for this task because it is the most common language for machine learning.  It has very performant libraries like numpy and scikit-learn that provide functionality for manipulating data and creating models that you cannot get in other languages like JavaScript and Java.  Additionally, it is the most familiar language for us to use for machine learning because almost every machine learning course teaches ml using python..Javascript will be used for both our frontend and backend on the web service.  JavaScript is ubiquitous as the language to use for the frontend.  For the backend, we decided to create our server using JavaScript because of its easy setup; using Express we can create a server in just a few short lines of code.  It is simple not only to run the server locally, but to host it as well because any major service will support the language.  JavaScript is a simple language to code in and familiar among our team members, so using it will help speed up development.  Using JavaScript allows us to use NodeJS and npm, so we can use packages to easily set up the server, connect to a database and other convenient utilities.  We also considered Python for our server.  It is also very simple to create a server in Python, especially using flask.  However, the extra familiarity with the JavaScript language and the ease of using packages were enough for us to pick JavaScript as our language of choice.. .Python is the default go-to for machine learning. It has a wide variety of useful packages such as pandas and numpy to aid with ML, as well as deep-learning frameworks. Furthermore, it is more production-friendly compared to other ML languages such as R..Pytorch is a deep-learning framework that is both flexible and fast compared to Tensorflow + Keras. It is also well documented and has a large community to answer lingering questions. .Python: The top language in machine learning area because of the various open-source libraries.

Thinking of this today makes me realize even more how great a decision this has been to learn, use and master Javascript. It has been a fun, challenging and productive road on which I am still satisfied. .Obviously, when I refer to Javascript, it is not without implying the vast ecosystem around it. For me, JS is a whole universe in which almost every imaginable tools exist. It's awesome - for real. Thanks to all the contributors which have made it possible. .To be even clearer about how intense I am with Javascript, let's just say that my first passion was music. Until, I find coding with Javascript! Yep, I know!.So in conclusion, I chose Javascript because it is versatile, enjoyable, widely used, productive for both desktop softwares and websites with ability to create modern great looking user interfaces (assuming HTML and CSS are involved) and finally there are job openings..Python has become the most popular language for machine learning right now since almost all machine learning tools provide service for this language, and it is really to use since it has many build-in objects like Hashtable. In C, you need to implement everything by yourself. .C++ is one of the most popular programming languages in graphics. It has many fancy libraries like eigen to help us process matrix. I have many previous projects about graphics based on C++ and this time, we also need to deal with graphics since we need to analyze movements of the human body. C++ has much more advantages than Java. C++ uses only compiler, whereas Java uses compiler and interpreter in both. C++ supports both operator overloading and method overloading whereas Java only supports method overloading. C++ supports manual object management with the help of new and delete keywords whereas Java has built-in automatic garbage collection..Go is a way faster than both Python and PHP, which is pretty understandable, but we were amazed at how good we adapted to use it. Go was a blessing for a team , since strict typing is making it very easy to develop and control everything inside team, so the quality was really good. We made huge leap forward in dev speed because of it..I am working in the domain of big data and machine learning. I am helping companies with bringing their machine learning models to the production. In many projects there is a tendency to port Python, PySpark code to Scala and Scala Spark.   .This yields to longer time to market and a lot of mistakes due to necessity to understand and re-write the code. Also many libraries/apis that data scientists/machine learning practitioners use are not available in jvm ecosystem.  .Simply, refactoring (if necessary) and organising the code of the data scientists by following best practices of software development is less error prone and faster comparing to re-write in Scala..Pipeline orchestration tools such as Luigi/Airflow is python native and fits well to this picture..I have heard some arguments against Python such as, it is slow, or it is hard to maintain due to its dynamically typed language. However cost/benefit of time consumed porting python code to java/scala alone would be enough as a counter-argument. ML pipelines rarerly contains a lot of code (if that is not the case, such as complex domain and significant amount of code, then scala would be a better fit).   .In terms of performance, I did not see any issues with Python. It is not the fastest runtime around but ML applications are rarely time-critical (majority of them is batch based)..I still prefer Scala for developing APIs and for applications where the domain contains complex logic..Pinterest.Pinterest.DigitalOcean.WorkOS.Pinterest.Rancher Labs.Red Hat, Inc..OneSignal",

In this series of blog posts, we’re going to explore how you can use each language to do the part it’s better and explore various methods of communication between Go & Python..In this post, we’ll learn how Go and Python programs can communicate between each other using .. This post assumes basic knowledge in both Go and Python..gRPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) framework from Google. It uses . as a serialization format and uses . as the transport medium..By using these two well established technologies, you gain access to a lot of knowledge and tooling that’s already available. Many companies I consult with use gRPC to connect internal services..Another advantage of using protocol buffers is that you write the message definition once, and then generate bindings to every language from the same source. This means that various services can be written in different programming languages and all the applications agree on the format of messages..Protocol buffers are also an efficient binary format: you gain both faster serialization times and less bytes over the wire, and this alone will save you money. Benchmarking on my machine, serialization time compared to JSON is about 7.5 faster and the data generated is about 4 times smaller.., also called anomaly detection, is a way of finding suspicious values in data. Modern systems collect a lot of metrics from their services, and it’s hard to come up with simple thresholds for finding malfunctioning services, which means waking on call developers at 2am too many times...We’ll start by implementing a Go service that collects metrics. Then, using gRPC, we’ll send these metrics to a Python service, which will perform outlier detection on them..In this project, we’re going with a simple approach of having Go as the main project and Python as a sub-project in the source tree..Listing1 shows the directory structure of our project. The project is using . and the name for the module is defined in the . file (see listing 2). We’re going to reference the module name ( .) in several places..Listing 2 shows what the . file looks like for our project. You can see on line 01 where the name of the module is defined..In gRPC, you start by writing a . file which defines the messages being sent and the RPC methods..Listing 3 shows what the . looks like. Important things to mention are on line 02 in listing 3, where we import the protocol buffers definition of ., and then on line 05, where we define the full Go package name - .A metric is a measurement of resource usage that is used for monitoring and diagnostics your system. We define a . on line 07, which has a timestamp, a name (e.g. “CPU”), and a float value. For example we can say that at . we measured . utilization..Every RPC method has an input type (or types) and an output type. Our method . (line 22) uses an . message type (line 13) as the input and an . message type (line 17) for the output. The . message type is a list/slice of Metric and the . message type is a list/slice of indices where the outlier values were found. For example, if we have the values of ., the result will be . which is the index of the outliers 100 and 200..In this section, we’ll go over the Python service code..Listing 4 shows how the code for the Python service is in the . directory off the root of the project..To generate the Python bindings you’ll need to install the . compiler, which you can download.. You can also install the compiler using your operating system package manager (e.g. ., . …).Once you have the compiler installed, you’ll need to install the Python . package..Listing 5 shows how to inspect and install the external dependencies for our Python project. The . specifies the external dependencies for the project, very much like how . specifies dependencies for Go projects..As you can see from the output of the . command, we need two external dependencies: . and . . A good practice is to have this file in source control and always version your dependencies (e.g. .), similar to what you would do with your . for your Go projects..Once you have the dependencies installed, you can generate the Python bindings..Listing 6 shows how to generate the Python binding for the gRPC support. Let’s break this long command in listing 5 down:.This Python command will run without any output, and at the end you’ll see two new files: . which is the protocol buffers code and . which is the gRPC client and server code..To write the Python service, you need to inherit from the . defined in . and override the . method. We’re going to use the numpy package and use a simple method of picking all the values that are more than two . from the ...Listing 7 shows the code in the . file. This is all the code we needed to write the Python service. In line 19 we override . from the generated . and write the actual outlier detection code. In line 34 we create a gRPC server that uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to run requests in parallel and in line 35 we register our OutliersServer to handle requests in the server..Listing 8 shows how to run the service..Now that we have our Python service running, we can write the Go client that will communicate with it..We’ll start by generating Go bindings for gRPC. To automate this process, I usually have a file called . with a . command to generate the bindings. You will need to download the . module which is the gRPC plugin for Go..Listing 9 shows the . file and how . is used to execute the gRPC plugin to generate the bindings..Let’s break down the command on line 04 which generates the bindings:.When you run . in the shell, you should see no output, but there will be a new file called . in the . directory..Listing 10 shows the . directory and the new file . that was generated by the . call. I add the . directory to source control so if the project is cloned to a new machine the project will work without requiring . to be installed on that machine..Now we can build and run the Go client..Listing 11 shows the code from .. The code fills an . value on line 23 with some dummy data (generated by the . function on line 34) and then on line 27 calls the Python service. The call to the Python service returns an . value..Let’s break down the code a little more:.Listing 12 shows you how to run the Go client. This assumes the Python server is running on the same machine..gRPC makes it easy and safe to pass messages from one service to another. You can maintain one place where all data types and methods are defined, and there is great tooling and best practices for the gRPC framework..The whole code: ., . and . is less than a 100 lines. You can view the project code ...There is much more to gRPC like timeout, load balancing, TLS, and streaming. I highly recommend going over the . read the documentation and play with the provided examples..In the next post in this series, we’ll flip the roles and have Python call a Go service..We have taught Go to thousands of developers all around the world since 2014. There is no other company that has been doing it longer and our material has proven to help jump start developers 6 to 12 months ahead of their knowledge of Go. We know what knowledge developers need in order to be productive and efficient when writing software in Go..Our classes are perfect for both experienced and beginning engineers.

        "Industry.Technology.Use-Case.Published: April 16, 2018.If you look at the ., you might notice most of the codebase is written in Go, although the checks we use to gather metrics are still written in Python. This is possible because the Datadog Agent, a regular Go binary, . a CPython interpreter that can be called whenever it needs to execute Python code. This process can be made transparent using an abstraction layer so that you can still write idiomatic Go code even when there’s Python running under the hood..There are a number of reasons why you might want to embed Python in a Go application:.The list could go on, but for the Datadog Agent the last point is crucial: we want you to be able to execute custom checks or change existing ones without forcing you to recompile the Agent, or in general, to compile anything..Embedding CPython is quite easy and well documented. The interpreter itself is written in C and a C API is provided to programmatically perform operations at a very low level, like creating objects, importing modules, and calling functions..In this article we’ll show some code examples, and we’ll focus on keeping the Go code idiomatic while interacting with Python at the same time, but before we proceed we need to address a small gap: the embedding API is C but our main application is Go, how can this possibly work?.There are . why you might not want to introduce cgo in your stack, but embedding CPython is one of those cases where you must. . is not a language nor a compiler. It’s a . (FFI), a mechanism we can use in Go to invoke functions and services written in a different language, specifically C..When we say “cgo” we’re actually referring to a set of tools, libraries, functions, and types that are used by the go toolchain under the hood so we can keep doing . to get our Go binaries. An absolutely minimal example of a program using cgo looks like this:.The comment block right above the . instruction is called a “preamble” and can contain actual C code, in this case an header inclusion. Once imported, the “C” pseudo-package lets us “jump” to the foreign code, accessing the . constant. You can build the example by invoking ., the same as if it was plain Go..If you want to have a look at all the work cgo does under the hood, run .. You’ll see the “cgo” tool will be invoked to generate some C and Go modules, then the C and Go compilers will be invoked to build the object modules and finally the linker will put everything together..You can read more about cgo on the .. The article contains more examples and few useful links to get further into details..Now that we have an idea of what cgo can do for us, let’s see how we can run some Python code using this mechanism..A Go program that, technically speaking, embeds CPython is not as complicated as you might expect. In fact, at the bare minimum, all we have to do is initialize the interpreter before running any Python code and finalize it when we’re done. Please note that we’re going to use Python 2.x throughout all the examples but everything we’ll see can be applied to Python 3.x as well with very little adaptation. Let’s look at an example:.The example above does exactly what the following Python code would do:.You can see we put a . directive in the preamble; those directives are passed to the toolchain to let you change the build workflow. In this case, we tell cgo to invoke “pkg-config” to gather the flags needed to build and link against a library called “python-2.7” and pass those flags to the C compiler. If you have the CPython development libraries installed in your system along with pkg-config, this would let you keep using a plain . to compile the example above..Back to the code, we use . and . to set up and shut down the interpreter and the . C function to retrieve the string containing the version information for the embedded interpreter..If you’re wondering, all the cgo bits we need to put together to invoke the C Python API are boilerplate code. This is why the Datadog Agent relies on . for all the embedding operations; the library provides a Go friendly thin wrapper around the C API and hides the cgo details. This is another basic embedding example, this time using go-python:.This looks closer to regular Go code, no more cgo exposed and we can use Go strings back and forth while accessing the Python API. Embedding looks powerful and developer friendly. Time to put the interpreter to good use: let’s try to load a Python module from disk..We don’t need anything complex on the Python side, the ubiquitous “hello world” will serve the purpose:.The Go code is slightly more complex but still readable:.Once built, we need to set the . environment variable to the current working dir so that the import statement will be able to find the . module. From a shell, the command would look like this:.Having to bring in cgo in order to embed Python is a tradeoff: builds will be slower, the Garbage Collector won’t help us managing memory used by the foreign system, and cross compilation will be non-trivial. Whether or not these are concerns for a specific project can be debated, but there’s something I deem not negotiable: the Go concurrency model. If we couldn’t run Python from a goroutine, using Go altogether would make very little sense..Before playing with concurrency, Python, and cgo, there’s something we need to know: it’s the Global Interpreter Lock, also known as the GIL. The GIL is a mechanism widely adopted in language interpreters (CPython is one of those) preventing more than one thread from running at the same time. This means that no Python program executed by CPython will be ever able to run in parallel within the same process. Concurrency is still possible and in the end, the lock is a good tradeoff between speed, security, and implementation simplicity. So why should this pose a problem when it comes to embedding?.When a regular, non-embedded Python program starts, there’s no GIL involved to avoid useless overhead in locking operations; the GIL starts the first time some Python code requests to spawn a thread. For each thread, the interpreter creates a data structure to store information about the current state and locks the GIL. When the thread has finished, the state is restored and the GIL unlocked, ready to be used by other threads..When we run Python from a Go program, none of the above happens automatically. Without the GIL, multiple Python threads could be created by our Go program. This could cause a race condition leading to fatal runtime errors, and most likely a segmentation fault bringing down the whole Go application..The solution to this problem is to explicitly invoke the GIL whenever we run multithreaded code from Go; the code is not complex because the C API provides all the tools we need. To better expose the problem, we need to do something CPU bounded from Python. Let’s add these functions to our foo.py module from the previous example:.We’ll try to print odd and even numbers concurrently from Go, using two different goroutines (thus involving threads):.While reading the example you might note a pattern, the pattern that will become our mantra to run embedded Python code:.The code should be straightforward but there’s a subtle detail we want to point out: notice that despite seconding the GIL mantra, in one case we operate the GIL by calling . and ., in another (look inside the goroutines) we do the same with . and ...We said when multithreading is operated from Python, the interpreter takes care of creating the data structure needed to store the current state, but when the same happens from the C API, we’re responsible for that..When we initialize the interpreter with go-python, we’re operating in a Python context. So when . is called it initializes the data structure and locks the GIL. We can use . and . to operate on already existing state..Inside the goroutines, we’re operating from a Go context and we need to explicitly create the state and remove it when done, which is what . and . do for us..At this point we know how to deal with multithreading Go code executing Python in an embedded interpreter but after the GIL, another challenge is right around the corner: the Go scheduler..When a goroutine starts, it’s scheduled for execution on one of the . threads available—. for more details on the topic. If a goroutine happens to perform a syscall or call C code, the current thread hands over the other goroutines waiting to run in the thread queue to another thread so they can have better chances to run; the current goroutine is paused, waiting for the syscall or the C function to return. When this happens, the thread tries to resume the paused goroutine, but if this is not possible, it asks the Go runtime to find another thread to complete the goroutine and goes to sleep. The goroutine is finally scheduled to another thread and it finishes..With this in mind, let’s see what can happen to a goroutine running some Python code when a goroutine is moved to a new thread::.Luckily for us, we can force the Go runtime to always keep our goroutine running on the same thread by calling the LockOSThread function from the runtime package from within a goroutine:.This will interfere with the scheduler and might introduce some overhead, but it’s a price that we’re willing to pay to avoid random panics..In order to embed Python, the Datadog Agent has to accept a few tradeoffs:.We’re happy to accept each of these for the convenience of running Python checks in Go. But by being conscious of the tradeoffs, we’re able to minimize their effect. Regarding other limitations introduced to support Python, we have few countermeasures to contain potential issues:.We’ll re-evaluate our options in the future and decide whether keeping around cgo is still worth it; we could even reconsider whether Python as a whole is still worth it, waiting for the . to be mature enough to support our use case. But for now the embedded Python is working well and transitioning from the old Agent to the new one couldn’t be easier..Are you a polyglot who loves mixing different programming languages?

        "Hi guys, I'm very good in bash (15 years and counting...), I used to do little C, especially with sockets, when I was a lot younger (10 years ago)..Now I'd like to learn a programming language: python or go? Possible outsider: node.js..I'd go with python because is very flexible, lots of libs, and not that difficult. But go is really trending now, and is faster. IMHO it can replace python and/or java for how is going faster..However, I can't learn both. I want to focus on one, because I don't have time for more..Any advice?.I do 'devops' work in both.  In this case, I suggest Python, with reasons following..I'll default to using Python unless there are specific reasons not to, in which case I go with golang..The canonical case for not going with Python is performance.  However, few devops development activities are actually language performance limited..Also, given your background, my guess is that you'll get productive in Python quite a bit more quickly than you'll get productive in golang..And honestly python's perf issues are not actually that bad - it just requires more domain specific knowledge than most folks are willing to give it.  Asyncio, futures, and the wide array of platforms, along with good design, go a long way..No, I would say the biggest reasons not to go with Python are:.Huge portability headaches.  If the script only needs to run on exactly one version of one OS, great!.  If the script needs to run on, e.g. multiple versions of Ubuntu and Windows, you may as well commit suicide.  Trying to get all the versions of libraries, Python, and native extensions aligned is Herculean.  With Go, compile once (or twice for *nix/Win) and run anywhere with zero dependency headaches..Tooling.  With Python, you're pretty much forced to build your own CI.  You're going to need to choose a testing library, a linting library, documentation tools, etc. and glue them all together.  With Go you get everything for free, and it's all integrated..Much saner concurrency and error handling.  Python concurrency is a joke; if you need any concurrency at all, it'd be much faster to just learn Go from scratch (it's a small language, you can learn it in a day or two) and use Go.  Also, Go forces you to think about errors and handle them correctly, rather than throwing an exception which will crash your program.  For a script, Python's great!  But we all know that \"temporary scripts\" somehow find their way into prod as single point failure services.  The time lost from a \"one off\" prod script crashing every other day due to unhandled edge cases easily covers the cost of rewriting that Python script in Go the moment it starts looking a bit important..If it's a one-off script that only needs to be run on dev workstations and every developer uses version X.XX of Ubuntu or whatever, great!  However, you'll start using Python for more and more, and inevitably you'll start hitting the pain points..The performance is just a bonus..Personally I'd learn python first and here's why:.It's older and more established, so more companies are likely to be using it..It's going to have a larger community; more code samples available, more SO questions answered..Both have interfacing with C though Python's C interface is a bit more reliable and encouraged, unlike that of Go..A lot of companies use python for scripting; lots of DevOps libraries are built with python (e.g. Ansible).There are pros to learning Go:.It's faster than python in most scenarios..It's syntax and environment (compiling and distributing binaries) is more related to C..At the end of the day, it probably doesn't matter which you chose first if you'll learn the other one. Weigh your pros and cons and decide..What problems are you trying to solve? What does your stack look like? Are there any major projects or migrations you are required to support in the coming year?.yes, exactly... in some cases python may fit the REST API better or have ssh libs you need In some cases you don't want to be writing a worker pool and setting up semaphores for python, and so would whip up some goroutines... delicious concurrency.Go is typically the language for system programming, which in the DevOps world is the tooling itself. So if you want to develop DevOps software, Go is a good choice..But if you are a DevOps practitioner then Python is definitely the way to go (i.e. you have production environments you're managing)..IMHO it can replace python and/or java for how is going faster.I have to disagree here. They solve different problems, and they really shine each in very different scenarios. If you're writing a Go bin to automate a process (that isn't time-bound), then I'd question the additional development effort. If you're writing Python to handle concurrent workloads requiring high performance, then I'd question the padding around the code you'd have to do to even try to get close to the requirements..They are both great and probably can work equally well in many instances. Not sure it's faster per-se though..When using Python, the only thing I miss from Go is the easyness to distribute your app since it's just a binary..If you want easier distribution, check out . You still need all the native libraries you use, but it may be easier than whole python distro..Yes Go is faster when it comes to program execution. Speed that you often don’t need when it comes to devops tooling or scripting..Python is easier to write and read, something that matters in all cases. The library ecosystem is much more developed in Python..In the end it’s a personal choice. I would recommend Python, you will be productive much faster and your code will be easier to understand without needing to know a lot of syntax..Let's not ignore the beauty of self-contained binaries with Go. It makes deployments of tools/apps dead simple..You'll learn faster using Python than Go. That being said I like Go better than Python..Python is more desirable in the enterprise simply because Go is still relatively young. So it has more libraries to chose from, more people know it, it's easier to find answers to problems, etc. I also write code way faster in python simply because it does a lot more of the grunt work for you. In DevOps this is desirable where you will often find yourself in companies that are wanting to move fast to hit MVPs..But, oh how Go is just better. But despite that doesn't mean you are going to be able to convince a manager that has a team of seasoned python developers to let you write your one micro-service in Golang instead. This is where approved technology debates come from and all that nonsense..Having some sockets in C knowledge and solid scripting experience will make learning python just a more pleasant experience. And it will still expose you to some of the lower-level programming concepts you don't have direct API access to using other scripting languages such as BASH. With those fundamentals, it will make learning Golang much easier, and I'd suggest you use Github, Open Source Contributions, and personal projects to further your knowledge there until it gets more of a foothold in larger companies..\"Learn a programming language every year.\".Python.Python is significantly more well accepted as a mainstream language. The availability of Python on your average box is much more common (especially now with Windows Subsystem for Linux)..From a career perspective, Go has its technical advantages, but many people will be unfamiliar with it. You improve your own marketability with the more familiar language, and anyone who knows anything about languages will figure that you can learn the more obscure language if necessary. You might be in love with a language because of it's apparent superiority, but it is unlikely to get you past your next HR screener. Of the languages/frameworks listed, I'd learn Python, Node.JS, and get around to Go last..As many others have said, Python is probably the best choice to learn first. Python is a faster turn-around for one-off scripts compared to Go, IMO. If you're building long-lived tools, Go might be the way to go (you can still do it in Python). If you're focusing on system management and scripting, Python will serve you much better IMO..You also commented on Node. I know Node, Python, and a few other languages. I . Node, but I wouldn't learn it as a first language. It's better now that async/await are there, but learning an asynchronous language as your first programming language will be painful, especially if you don't have someone knowledgable to guide you..I can't learn both..Lies! Of course you can. Maybe not at the same time, but you can (and probably should) learn both. Ruby would probably be a good idea too for any DevOps/SysOps engineer. I try to pick up at least one new language or significant technology every year. Go was year before last, Terraform last year, this year CloudFoundry..You don't have to become an expert in everything, but broadening your horizons and learning different paradigms gives you a more well-rounded perspective when approaching any task, even if you're not directly applying the technology you've learned..I became really interested in Go after watching this video: .I hope it can inspire you too. :).Of course it's a valid and solid point he makes that if your tickets read \"go perform these 15 manual steps\" then you are failing. That's what automation is for..Other than that I don't see any good points. He is trying to convince us that Go is a better replacement for shell scripts over Python..Why exactly?.Because Go does OS-detection automatically in file names? That's very marginal..He says that Python was not designed as a \"software engineering language\" but a \"scripting language\". Oh, please. This is just FUD. It's not even true, but even if it was, I don't care what the language used to be, I care what the language is today..Feels like this guy has an agenda, rather than trying to help people be better..Both are good languages, for very different reasons..Great for advanced shell/system scripts, as a replacement for Bash..Great all-round language for general purpose programs, such as CLI tools, Build scripts, Web apps, GUI programs..Excellent readability, probably the best language to learn programming with..Strong solution for portability, libraries can be compiled into a single main binary that can be copied straight to a target machine..Better performance than Python due to it being compiled and more strict..Stricter with types and such, improves correctness (but not as much as a functional programming language)..IMHO the first point for Go (portability) really is the main selling point. Other than that, you will be paying a tax with Go compared to Python when it comes to implementation speed and maintainability. Also, I think exceptions are a darn good feature in a programming language, which Go does not have..Performance is rarely the issue, especially for a DevOps person. Python wins out 90% of the time due to readability, maintainability, compatibility, availability of libraries, etc..Strictness is kind of a dud, sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. But generally speaking, strictness is mostly interesting in the actual application business logic, not in system tools that make up the infrastructure platform..Go basically has three main use cases:.Widely distributed cross platform programs, like Terraform..Cross platform system daemons, like Consul. Or some kind of system monitoring..Custom, high performance, concurrent, network server programs. Like an API Gateway, request router, packet inspector, or something like that..Use Python for everything else..As a DevOps who works with Python, Go and Java among other languages/tools... Both are quite different..Disclaimer: I'm a huuuuuuge fan of Go, is my main lenguage..First of all, Go will never be Java. The approximation to the OO paradigm in both languages is so different... And don't forget Python which is OO too but... Again, quite different..So, every languages will have a niche..With that in mind. Don't learn a language. Learn how to program. Sounds silly?

        "Hi guys, I'm very good in bash (15 years and counting...), I used to do little C, especially with sockets, when I was a lot younger (10 years ago)..Now I'd like to learn a programming language: python or go? Possible outsider: node.js..I'd go with python because is very flexible, lots of libs, and not that difficult. But go is really trending now, and is faster. IMHO it can replace python and/or java for how is going faster..However, I can't learn both. I want to focus on one, because I don't have time for more..Any advice?.I do 'devops' work in both.  In this case, I suggest Python, with reasons following..I'll default to using Python unless there are specific reasons not to, in which case I go with golang..The canonical case for not going with Python is performance.  However, few devops development activities are actually language performance limited..Also, given your background, my guess is that you'll get productive in Python quite a bit more quickly than you'll get productive in golang..And honestly python's perf issues are not actually that bad - it just requires more domain specific knowledge than most folks are willing to give it.  Asyncio, futures, and the wide array of platforms, along with good design, go a long way..No, I would say the biggest reasons not to go with Python are:.Huge portability headaches.  If the script only needs to run on exactly one version of one OS, great!.  If the script needs to run on, e.g. multiple versions of Ubuntu and Windows, you may as well commit suicide.  Trying to get all the versions of libraries, Python, and native extensions aligned is Herculean.  With Go, compile once (or twice for *nix/Win) and run anywhere with zero dependency headaches..Tooling.  With Python, you're pretty much forced to build your own CI.  You're going to need to choose a testing library, a linting library, documentation tools, etc. and glue them all together.  With Go you get everything for free, and it's all integrated..Much saner concurrency and error handling.  Python concurrency is a joke; if you need any concurrency at all, it'd be much faster to just learn Go from scratch (it's a small language, you can learn it in a day or two) and use Go.  Also, Go forces you to think about errors and handle them correctly, rather than throwing an exception which will crash your program.  For a script, Python's great!  But we all know that \"temporary scripts\" somehow find their way into prod as single point failure services.  The time lost from a \"one off\" prod script crashing every other day due to unhandled edge cases easily covers the cost of rewriting that Python script in Go the moment it starts looking a bit important..If it's a one-off script that only needs to be run on dev workstations and every developer uses version X.XX of Ubuntu or whatever, great!  However, you'll start using Python for more and more, and inevitably you'll start hitting the pain points..The performance is just a bonus..Personally I'd learn python first and here's why:.It's older and more established, so more companies are likely to be using it..It's going to have a larger community; more code samples available, more SO questions answered..Both have interfacing with C though Python's C interface is a bit more reliable and encouraged, unlike that of Go..A lot of companies use python for scripting; lots of DevOps libraries are built with python (e.g. Ansible).There are pros to learning Go:.It's faster than python in most scenarios..It's syntax and environment (compiling and distributing binaries) is more related to C..At the end of the day, it probably doesn't matter which you chose first if you'll learn the other one. Weigh your pros and cons and decide..What problems are you trying to solve? What does your stack look like? Are there any major projects or migrations you are required to support in the coming year?.yes, exactly... in some cases python may fit the REST API better or have ssh libs you need In some cases you don't want to be writing a worker pool and setting up semaphores for python, and so would whip up some goroutines... delicious concurrency.Go is typically the language for system programming, which in the DevOps world is the tooling itself. So if you want to develop DevOps software, Go is a good choice..But if you are a DevOps practitioner then Python is definitely the way to go (i.e. you have production environments you're managing)..IMHO it can replace python and/or java for how is going faster.I have to disagree here. They solve different problems, and they really shine each in very different scenarios. If you're writing a Go bin to automate a process (that isn't time-bound), then I'd question the additional development effort. If you're writing Python to handle concurrent workloads requiring high performance, then I'd question the padding around the code you'd have to do to even try to get close to the requirements..They are both great and probably can work equally well in many instances. Not sure it's faster per-se though..When using Python, the only thing I miss from Go is the easyness to distribute your app since it's just a binary..If you want easier distribution, check out . You still need all the native libraries you use, but it may be easier than whole python distro..Yes Go is faster when it comes to program execution. Speed that you often don’t need when it comes to devops tooling or scripting..Python is easier to write and read, something that matters in all cases. The library ecosystem is much more developed in Python..In the end it’s a personal choice. I would recommend Python, you will be productive much faster and your code will be easier to understand without needing to know a lot of syntax..Let's not ignore the beauty of self-contained binaries with Go. It makes deployments of tools/apps dead simple..You'll learn faster using Python than Go. That being said I like Go better than Python..Python is more desirable in the enterprise simply because Go is still relatively young. So it has more libraries to chose from, more people know it, it's easier to find answers to problems, etc. I also write code way faster in python simply because it does a lot more of the grunt work for you. In DevOps this is desirable where you will often find yourself in companies that are wanting to move fast to hit MVPs..But, oh how Go is just better. But despite that doesn't mean you are going to be able to convince a manager that has a team of seasoned python developers to let you write your one micro-service in Golang instead. This is where approved technology debates come from and all that nonsense..Having some sockets in C knowledge and solid scripting experience will make learning python just a more pleasant experience. And it will still expose you to some of the lower-level programming concepts you don't have direct API access to using other scripting languages such as BASH. With those fundamentals, it will make learning Golang much easier, and I'd suggest you use Github, Open Source Contributions, and personal projects to further your knowledge there until it gets more of a foothold in larger companies..\"Learn a programming language every year.\".Python.Python is significantly more well accepted as a mainstream language. The availability of Python on your average box is much more common (especially now with Windows Subsystem for Linux)..From a career perspective, Go has its technical advantages, but many people will be unfamiliar with it. You improve your own marketability with the more familiar language, and anyone who knows anything about languages will figure that you can learn the more obscure language if necessary. You might be in love with a language because of it's apparent superiority, but it is unlikely to get you past your next HR screener. Of the languages/frameworks listed, I'd learn Python, Node.JS, and get around to Go last..As many others have said, Python is probably the best choice to learn first. Python is a faster turn-around for one-off scripts compared to Go, IMO. If you're building long-lived tools, Go might be the way to go (you can still do it in Python). If you're focusing on system management and scripting, Python will serve you much better IMO..You also commented on Node. I know Node, Python, and a few other languages. I . Node, but I wouldn't learn it as a first language. It's better now that async/await are there, but learning an asynchronous language as your first programming language will be painful, especially if you don't have someone knowledgable to guide you..I can't learn both..Lies! Of course you can. Maybe not at the same time, but you can (and probably should) learn both. Ruby would probably be a good idea too for any DevOps/SysOps engineer. I try to pick up at least one new language or significant technology every year.

        "I'm just getting into python and so far I like it, I've used other languages over the years in small amounts but I wanted to settle on one, i was tossing up between Java and python..So now that I'm reading more about python I'm seeing more and more post about ditching python and going go. It seems go is faster, smarter and all round more efficient. So I'm not sure if I should jump ship before getting to into python..I don't really have an end goal for what i want to make but i am interested in web apps and web front ends and from what I'm reading, go's strength is more the back end server stuff..So my question is, should I jump ship? Is go versatile? Is there a large support network like pythons? Is there anything wrong with python?.. ..EDIT: Thanks everyone for the interesting read, I'm more confused now :) I think I will stick with Python for now, there is more training material out there and larger community. Go does seem like a brilliant \"new\" language, but for web apps and web page front ends, python does still seem to be more mature. Thanks.As a python programmer by trade, here are three reasons not to use python:.Dynamic compilation can result in errors that exist in code, but are not detected:.This is perfrectly valid python:.Of course if you add junk() to the end, it will fail with errors about missing functions and variables; but compiled languages like go don't suffer from this problem..CPython really is ...Very specifically, procedures that are invoked multiple times are not optimized to run more quickly in future runs (like pypy), they always run at the same slow speed. So operations like populating matricies and doing matrix maths are .. So slow in fact that future version (3.5? See .) will have an explicit operator for this..You can get around this by calling c libraries, but it's irritating as a developer to write something in python, realize its too slow, and then have to rewrite it again in C. Very. Very. Irritating..Python has a terrible distribution story..Virtualenv, buildout, pip, easy_install, distribute: they all boil down to the same thing; it's really hard to ship all your python dependencies onto a new system.....and even then, if you have a perfectly setup version pin for every library, it can . break when (for example) freetype upgrades and your old pinned version of Pillow doesn't compile any more. Oh? You had some dependencies on the old version of pillow? Upgrade all the things!.There are a few 'binary builders' for python like pyinstaller, cx_freeze; but they're pretty rubbish practically speaking. Even the best showcase of these tools ends up shipping simple GUI apps like Calibre that are . in size..Let's not even talk about writing something in py3 and getting half way in to discover a core dependency hasn't been ported yet....Go addresses those points pretty sharply; good distribution story with static binaries; repeatable build process (abit hindered by the same issues as python when you bind a c library; but at least you . statically link C libraries into go binaries), and it's really pretty fast..So is it worth abandoning python?.Probably, professionally, not really; especially if you're looking at web development..The ecosystem for python is really strong, and there are some really decent web tool kits like flask, pyramid, some great libraries like sqlalchemy, and a lot of support for it from the academic community for stuff like natural language processing.....but would I build a GUI app or a game in it instead of Java or Go if I had to start tomorrow?.Absolutely fucking not..Yes, the dependencies problem is my number one issue with Python, and Go just doesn't have that issue AT ALL. Beautiful..Speed is probably the big one. Once you try to run a service on Python at scale, you run hard into the fact that Python is in the slowest class of languages. It's extremely dynamic and constantly looking things up in layers of hashes... and yet, if you're writing server code you're probably just writing in a simpler subset that doesn't use all these layers very often, so you don't really need them..It is a common misconception that \"cloud\" means you don't have to worry about performance, just throw more servers at the problem! Nevertheless, the delta between Go and Python is . 10 times and can be as much as 100 in some cases you might actually encounter, and that's . you factor in the fact that Go can actually multiprocess efficiently. Even in the cloud, your boss will notice the difference between 1 Amazon large instance and 100 Amazon large instances, even if you do get to spin down half of them half the time..The static typing is also very helpful for problems like this, and the implicit interfaces in Go cover most of the rest of the duck-typing use cases in Python..That said, it's a great language to have in your toolbelt, it can still be useful for many other things, and I personally think it's clearly the best of its language class (Perl, Javascript, Ruby, Lua), even with the 2/3 issues. But at this point I wouldn't consider deploying it for a server solution for anything I plan on scaling... the performance hit is . enormous that it ties your hands quite early..(Before anyone says \"PyPy\" or anything, bear in mind that when you hear that PyPy can make Python run twice as fast or something, you need to consider the baseline that number starts from, which is . 20 times slower than Go. Cutting execution time in half merely gets you to . 10 times slower than Go, and frankly that's still an optimistic number. Same goes for JS... after years of hearing about how the most recent engine is 20% faster than the previous one people have this idea that the sum total of all the speed improvements make it \"C-speed\".... in fact that's not the case, and that's why asm.js is necessary. And asm.js currently actually only gets to about half C speed, which, coincidentally, is also where Go is right now, about half C speed. As language performance is best understood logarithmically, that's actually pretty good; there's a lot of solid languages that clock in at about half-C speed, and I expect Go to still get faster. Based on the language I expect it to end up around 20-50% slower than C in the end... by its nature idiomatic Go just won't ever quite get to the raw speed of C, but it'll get close enough you won't much care.).i guess, a lot of people are annoyed by the fragmentation caused by python2 and python3..And while go was designed to build large concurrent applications, a lot of people (including myself) find that go is also a very nice fit for small applications for which you usually would have chosen bash for..It really does seem like they saw the crazy mess that Perl self-destructed on and thought, \"We gotta be like Perl!\".There is nothing wrong with python except maybe that it is not staticly typed and might be a little slow (depends on the use case)..Go is the new kid on the block, and while Go is nice, it doesn't have nearly as many libraries as python does..Personally I prefer Go the language, but when it comes to stable, mature third party packages, it can't beat python at the moment..I actually agree with your hypothesis, though I have some personal biases as it describes my own path.  I have a decent amount of history both in the Python community and in the Go community so I'll chime in on why I've . left Python behind for Go and why programmers in other languages might not have..Among the big 5 scripting languages (Perl, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, PHP), I'd say that 2 undeniably were founded for and still largely popular on the web;  PHP and JavaScript..The other 3 are \"more\" general purpose as languages (with JavaScript on the server being a recent development).  Perl found its legs as a sed/awk/bash replacement first, and expanded into the cgi world.  This was essentially before computers were fast enough to run large systems built in such a language, and thus it became characterized mostly as a great language for throwaway scripts (not a slight, these are . important, eg. when responding to outages)..Python and Ruby got their popularity later than Perl, despite being around about the same time.  The early days of Python2 (and even the late days of Python1.5) saw companies take up Python as a programming language for .;  they saw it as a language which was easier and less error prone than C/C++ and less verbose and cumbersome than Java.  Its niche was really large, too;  it worked well for tool development but turned out to be pretty usable for writing server side applications as well, and eventually spread onto the web (early attempts like mod_python/PSP, Zope, etc made few converts;  it was Django in ca. 2005 that really made the big splash)..Ruby's popularity grew slower than Python's, but took off with RoR (2004 I believe), giving it explosive growth in the web camp.  Later, true to its lineage, it ate into some of Perl's territory as a sysadmin's language, but only because it was already established as a language on everyone's web boxes.  It suffered a bit on the systems programming side because the VM during its popularity explosion was initially not as good Python's, and it got this reputation for being slow and using lots of memory (things that are not big deals for web applications;  just restart.).So out of the 5, I think only Python really made significant inroads in the software niche that Go has started to make a name in.  And most Python programmers there have struggled for years with high memory usage, the single processor limit, and difficulty in achieving high single-processor performance (CPython's hashes all the way down).  Go came out as a halfway house between C and Python which . like those languages, too.  Java was always there, mind you, but its build/distribution nightmare, verbose syntax and IDE reliance was unpalatable..People aren't ditching RoR, Django, Symfony, etc for large web projects in favor of Go, because those come with . many vital batteries that many developers don't know how to fashion themselves.  It's a niche that Go might someday infiltrate, but the current library support isn't there for ...tl;dr: Python, moreso than Ruby and other imperative dynamic languages, was used in the same niche that Go is starting to slowly dominate, so it's seeing the most initial converts..People aren't ditching RoR, Django, Symfony, etc for large web projects in favor of Go, because those come with so many vital batteries that many developers don't know how to fashion themselves. It's a niche that Go might someday infiltrate, but the current library support isn't there for those kinds of developers..Or they simply don't have the time/budget and just need to get the job done without reinventing wheels..Straight from Rob Pike's mouth: . (6 min video).Appengine users are a big reason for this. Go app startup time is milliseconds, way faster than python. Goroutines allow for concurrent programming on appengine while python threading is disabled there..There are many more but this was just the first thoughts of the top of my head..You sound like you're fairly new to programming..Python will be easier to learn than Go, and there are more, and more diverse, resources out there for Python than Go..I think the difference in learning Go vs learning Python will be considerable for an inexperienced programmer. If you mostly want to do web apps, and mostly focus on the front end at that, I'd choose Python..There's a lot of cool things in Go--I wasn't reading . when I saw this--but expect to gear down and go slow if you're going to use Go as your first \"real\" language..I disagree with python being easier to learn than Go.  The compiler and static types are a huge help in getting your code to actually work.  Go and Python code look remarkably similar for simple programs that most newbies would write..I tried go. For data modeling, statistics I would never consider it. Surely Python is slow but there is cython which gave me around 200 times speed up when I had to optimize some tight loops which I couldnt vectorize with numpy..The only thing I hate in Python is terrible support for parallelization..Agreed with the other commenters..But one addition:.should I jump ship?.No - you should use the right tool for the job in each individual case. Often, the best option will be a mixture of a number of different languages..I used to think this was the case, but then think about how difficult it will be to find people with the right skillset?  There is probably a lot of overlap between Go and Python devs (in that people that know Go will probably know Python) but it still restricts the pool of people that you can work with..my recommendation is to become fluent in many more than just \"one\" language..my toolkit has Perl, Python, Go and C in it. That suits my job, but that's because for example i dont need to write Android apps -- if i did, i would need to add Java. If I had to write browser smarts, I would need Javascript in my box..The reasons for my choices are nothing to do with how nice the syntax is. All languages suck, and you will find godawful things in all of them. What is important for me is.comprehensive libraries.great documentation.helpful communities.ease of getting started.in your Python vs Go example, I think they are both quite good on all these fronts. Python is more mature and has a bigger 1, 2, and 3. Go is surprisingly good in this area despite being so young, but its redeeming quality is how easy it is to write and think about concurrency. It kicks butt in this area.I'm not sure that many people are ditching python for go.  Python is quite mature and is past its days of being the fun new toy.  Now it is useful, reliable and well understood.  It has its limitations, but they don't impact all users..My personal experience is that I found go interesting, but I'm too addicted to some of python's features that go lacks, such as operator overloading and duck typing.  It may be that I didn't take enough time to grok go but it remained much easier for me to write something in python than in go..I've quit playing with go and am spending some time to learn rust.  It's not that I want to replace python, but the optimist in me hopes that someone will make a language that is as easy to program as python, runs as fast as compiled C, and makes it hard to shoot yourself in the foot, even in a concurrent environment.  I don't think go quite gets there due to the generics problem (which makes it not as easy to program as python) and I don't think it goes far enough to make concurrency safe.  I'm not sure if rust is or will be that language, but the authors are trying..Try cython. It is really impressive..Speed and cleanliness..Python is nice for throwing something together, but it gets ugly and it's inferior in performance..Python has (for now) a much larger ecosystem, job market, etc. For web development it's still a very solid choice with mature frameworks such as Django and Flask..Go is faster, but for 99% of web applications that's not a huge deal - your bottleneck is more likely to be the database..Go shines in specific things like concurrency - if I had to build a chat app or something with websockets, I'd absolutely use Go over Python but for building lots of CRUD screens, Python is definitely easier - I recently started a side project using Go but ended up ditching it for Python + Django Rest Framework and accomplished more in a day than I had in a whole week, not because Go is more verbose/harder than Python (it is, but not significantly so) but because Python just had more off-the-shelf libraries for everything I needed..Python is also much easier for opening up a shell and doing off the cuff scripts..In a couple of years this may change as the Go ecosystem matures and standardizes (so there aren't a dozen competing web frameworks for example, something that plagued Python 10 years ago), but in the meantime there's nothing to lose by learning both..Members.Online",

        "This article shouldn't say to you: \"See, Go is BAD, Python is GOOD!\" It should say, \"That's an interesting case study. If I'm working on a project that involves lots of sockets and concurrency, I'll want to take what they said into account when I'm making technology decisions.\".\n.[edit: grammar].\n.Goroutines feel cheap, but if you're holding 140k connections, and just 20k of them do something that spins up a goroutine each... you can easily exceed the memory constraint. As such, we had to put goroutine pools in place, careful select statements around them from connections to ensure we didn't overwhelm external resources, etc. It was a huge pain. It has been drastically easier to control resource usage with these constraints under python/twisted..YMMV, of course, this is just our experience. Part of the reason for putting it out there is that there are . many people who have talked/blogged about going from Python -> Go. I thought maybe the world could handle just one story about going the other direction..\n.\n.\n.Did you try something like that?.\n.\n.One thing I wish was possible in go is being able to use the `select` keyword with both channels and IO..\n.E.g. what do you do if you want to send notifications to lots of clients but for some the connection is very slow (you would probably need to buffer the data)? Do you have hard limits of maximum buffered data until you close the connection? End to end backpressure (for which channels are quite good) doesn't seem like the best option for 1:N broadcasts, because then the slowest receiver slows down all others..And what do you do with connections which are sending you lots of (probably unexcepted) data? Stop reading from that socket?.\n.In our case, when notifications buffer for a slow client, this API gets triggered and we mark the client connection as 'paused'. Until that state is cleared by more data getting to the client, notifications go to the database instead with just a flag on the client connection to check the db when the pending data was retrieved..We do a similar thing on the receiving end to pause reading off the socket if we're already doing more work on behalf of the client at once than desired..twisted documents this as producer/consumer: .\n.\n.\n.This post reminds me of another post I recently saw on HN, in which the author (someone with an Erlang background) lays out all sorts of reasons why he chose Ruby for a highly concurrent application that launches lots of (heavyweight) threads.  Upon seeing the link on HN, my first thought was, Ruby!!??  But then I read the post and the reasons were all very sensible and practical-minded, so in that case Ruby was arguably a much better choice than Erlang, Go, Scala, Rust, etc. for a highly concurrent application..Edit: here's the post I mentioned about Ruby being used for a highly concurrent application: .\n.The problems I observed with Go was that its regex  seemed to be slower than Python, and memory usage was way higher. I explicitly added some GC requests..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.For example, to extract links from hacker news homepage, you would just do.\nThis will be really fast. You can do it even faster with a more specific xpath.  I extracted about 10k links a second from documents this way and was still network bound.  Usually you are primarily limited by websites throttling you..\n.\n.Go's a good language for some things. But it does nothing special or significant to close the massive productivity gap between dynamic and static language. Yes, it's terse compared to many other static language and it has stuff like implicit interfaces, but those are superficial (but nice) things when it comes to what and how you do things in dynamic land. Go might actually be a step back due to its poor type system and poor reflection capabilities..I think Go's great for a seemingly new breed of \"infrastructure\" systems which is becoming more important due to how systems are starting to be designed (services hosted in the cloud). It's great for building CLI which don't require your customers to install anything else. And it's good for a services / apps that needs to share memory between threads (which, in my experience, is where dynamic languages really start to fail)..But for a traditional web app / service? It's horrible. At least as horrible as most static languages. It sucks for talking to databases (more than almost any other language I've used). It sucks for dealing with user-input. Like most static languages, the stuff you need to do to handle a request, which has essentially 1ms of life, is cumbersome, error prone, slow, inflexible and difficult to test..\n.You want my anecdote? Go is brilliant for web services. We've decreased server costs significantly while decreasing response times by orders of magnitude for write-heavy APIs. Concurrency primitives that do bleed into parallelism have made a mockery of interpreted dynamic languages..But don't believe me. Ask Cloudflare, or Google, or Dropbox, or any other number of companies how horrible Go has been..But just for shits and grins, I'll bet it'd take me moments to find people in situations where Go didn't meet their needs or domain requirements..Please stop with the absolutes. They're absolutely ridiculous..\n.\n.Precisely, and isn't this presentation the perfect example of this phenomenon?.* Initially we had an implementation in language X.* We then rewrote it in language Y - the lessons learned by making the system anew (this time knowing the exact problematic spots, what really to optimize for, etc) - we got a better system. Long live language Y.* We then rewrote it in language X - the lessons learned [...] - we got a better system. Long live language X.Good programmers can productively write good and fast code in C, Python, Java, Go, or whatever. The skill of the developer and the understanding of the problem matters much more than the programming language.\n.This is part of why Rust removed the M:N scheduler and light-weight threads before Rust 1.0. It's hard to predict your memory use if the run-time is going to be creating/destroying OS threads, and juggling your lightweight threads (goroutines/etc) between real OS threads..I agree entirely that the next iteration you write to solve the same problem is going to be better than the one before. The problem-scope is well defined, and you're already familiar with it and where the prior implementation was lacking. In this case the extra predictability of knowing what was going to be occurring at once did help..\n.\n.So while I was blocked on a coworker filling in one of the gaps we both needed, I was able to rewrite it all in Python..I'll probably give this talk again at a venue where it'll be recorded, which should add a lot of missing context to these slides..\n.\n.A web app has 4 (often more, rarely less) such boundary:.- Getting input from users.- Querying a database.- Getting results from a database.- Outputting results to the user (html, json, ....).Within these boundaries, yes, static languages are less error prone. But you get no compile time checks AT the boundaries. You'll need integration tests (and it's easier to write tests in a dynamic language (where IoC is a language feature) than static languages..You deal with these boundaries via automated mapping (with annotations, or external files (like in Hibernate)) or manual mapping. Automated mapping might not be much more error prone,  but it's certainly much more cumbersome (especially with weak reflection). Manual mapping is also much more cumbersome. Does this cumbersomeness make it more error prone? I don't think it helps..\n.That data is always a string (given the nature off HTTP requests). So the only issue there is converting the string to an integer when necessary. But since you should cleanse any data that arrives via HTTP request, you'd need to validate that your \"integers\" are actually purely numeric even in dynamically typed languages. So there's really no extra work there between dynamic and static languages..You'd be querying an SQL database with either parametrised queries or ORMs. Both of which are data-type agnostic (ie you wouldn't be needing to convert integers into strings to embed into SQL strings)..As for No-SQL databases, there might be an issue with some and statically typed languages. But that's not an issue I've ran into with the languages and APIs against the (admittedly limited) range of no-SQL databases I've used..This is where your argument is the strongest. Sometimes there can be an issue if you don't know what return values you're expecting from the database. But that's easily overcome if you actually chat to your database architects before hand. But in all honesty, I'd be disappointed in any web developer who wasn't the least bit interested in the datatypes of the records he's querying nor the structure of the database he's effectively writing a frontend for..All HTML is string, so that's a moot point. JSON, XML, etc is more a data structure problem than a data type problem. In fact I sometimes argue that JSON is statically typed since it has strings (in quotations), integers (no quotations), boolean (true / false), arrays and hashes / maps. So the real problem with exporting formats like JSON and XML is really a question of how good a language API is. Take C# for example, there's several different APIs available for encoding XML, some are appallingly bad and need about a page of boilerplate code, others are ridiculously simple. To go back on topic with Go, I've only ever worked with JSON, but outputting that in Go is very easy as Go's JSON encoder basically just takes whatever your data structure is and returns it's JSON encoded string counterpart (much like how Perl and Javascript work with JSON)..I do get the points you're making, and you're right that sometimes statically typed languages do make you jump through a few additional hoops. But most of the times these issues only arise if you're a careless programmer - in which case you're going to run into all sorts of dumb issues even with dynamically typed languages (eg if you don't validate your input data then you're going to write less secure web applications - regardless of your language of choice. That's why I sometimes look at statically typed languages as just another layer of data validation with regards to web development).\n.Lets take a few statements:.Yes, the rewrite would certainly have helped. However some compilers and runtimes . just faster than others. You wouldn't say that rewriting C code in Perl would result in faster code would you? Of course not. But that's the implication of your post. Go . outperform some languages. Granted it's still slower than some others out there, but not all languages are equal in terms of performance so it's pretty naive to imply they are..That's completely rubbish. Go is a young language, that much is true. But it's ecosystem is actually very impressive given it's age. Since you're talking about web development, lets look at all the libraries you might want:.\nI've no doubt missed some stuff that you probably use, but that's not a reflection of stuff missing from Go either. The fact is, in all practicality, there isn't much you need to rewrite in Go aside the web application itself..This sounds more like a rant about how much you hate statically typed languages than it does about how poor Go is compared to [insert preferred language]. For what it's worth, statically typed languages do also offer some productivity bonuses over dynamically typed languages: a big one being the fussier compiler / runtime checking can pick up subtle bugs (eg 0 / \"0\" / false) that might otherwise take a little while to trace. And I am aware that some dynamic languages have typed checking operators, eg ===, but you can't always guarantee what you're libraries are going to handle / return so you're still sometimes left tracing values up the code base to find the origin of the problem rather than having the compiler explicitly tell you at the first point where your uncleansed data arrives..So there are also advantages with going down the statically typed route..Sorry, but now you're just descending into unashamed language bigotry. A large proportion of the worlds cloud services are supported by statically typed platforms such as ASP.NET, Java, and Go. This forum, HN, is written in Haskell, which is also statically typed. Saying . is so far off the mark that it's just plain ignorant..Which is a real pity as there would have been a few good points raised in your rant if you hadn't have jumped off in the deep end with your ridiculous generalisations..\n.No, it's written in Arc, which is a variant of Lisp and is not statically typed..\n.I know I've been heavily down voted in my previous comment, but I've developed in well over dozen different languages of different paradigms for the last 3 decades - so I have quite a broad range of experience as well as being language agnostic - ie I'm not just some angry fanboy :p.\n.\n.I will grant you that Go does get a little more awkward if you're dealing with null data types in the database as you then need to start casting interfaces. Which gets a pain real quick. But it's rare that you actually . null types in the database - usually that requirement can be circumvented at the database design level (eg using default values in the table design or defining flag fields)..Sometimes a different language will require you to architect your platform a little differently, but that's kind of the point of having different tools..\n.Although I corrected your interlocutor on a factual inaccuracy, I actually fully agree with him/her on the principle,  and as the author of a strongly-typed database access library (Opaleye for Haskell) I'm in a very good position to!.\n.Both Python and Go are fine. They both have their strengths and weaknesses. I personally wouldn't write a web app in Go (at least, anything beyond the most basic admin interface). I also personally wouldn't write a very large and complex Python system given the huge unit testing burden necessary to ensure safe refactoring down the road..The biggest reason I like Go is because it makes it really hard for engineers to create huge, complex abstractions. Engineers (and especially less experienced engineers) just love them some abstractions. In my experience, most abstractions aren't justifiable. The net effect is that it usually makes their software harder to learn, harder to debug, inflexible (ironically), and late for whatever deadline they were supposed to hit. You can't write Java enterprise software in Go, and I really appreciate that..\n.\nThe totally misplaced condescension is one of many reasons the Go community appears to be a net negative..\n.You know what really grinds our gears, though? People who don't read documentation..If you don't read documentation, you'll get a negative vibe. Because your question is literally sitting at the top of the FAQ. It's been asked 2^1024 times before. WHY WON'T YOU READ THE DOCS?.\n.\n.\n.You can, and I've seen it, unfortunately..\n.\n.\n.\n.As a side note, sometimes you do need that performance gain, without wanting to resort to C or C++. I hope to see Python make some gains there with the addition of the type information..\n.\n.Why do you consider unit testing a burden? I find unit tests the best way to formalize specifications before even starting to write code..\n.[1] .\n.\n.Personally, I do love me a type system. Even if you have to think harder about how to architect your code, I think this kind of thinking is . for software to be good..\n.\n.SSL is extremely expensive, on RAM (perhaps the implementations have optimized for throughput over RAM). I have yet to benchmark any SSL implementation in any language, with any binding, that can use less than 20kb per SSL connection. I mentioned in my talk here that SSL is very expensive, here's my benchmark suite that others may add to:\n.I have implementations in several languages, so far both Go and Python 3.4 can get as low as the 20kb cited. If you can get your per-connection state below 20kb, then merely adding SSL means . your RAM requirements, which is huge..I appreciate that everyone loves obsessing on the language wars, but the SSL RAM overhead affects us regardless of language. I covered that in one of the slides near the end, it'd be great to see some movement on reducing the RAM footprint here..\n.\n.Every connection has a base cost of the TCP kernel send/recv buffer, which in our case we dropped a bit to 4kb each. So that's still 8kb per connection right there. If we terminate the SSL on a separate machine from where we handle the connection, then it means we'll be using 8kb more memory per connection. Probably even greater because nginx has its own send/recv buffers for data..I'm sure our use-case is a unique one, most people care about raw through-put so the majority of SSL optimization has focused on lowering CPU use under high load rather than memory use under massive amounts of connections..\n.\n.\n.\n.I've had good luck writing applications in Python, then profiling them and implementing critical sections that are CPU bound in C as modules. Any sections that are memory hogs can be converted to stream processors..Lately I've started implementing the modules with Rust and the results are promising.  It seems like a nice balance of developer productivity and application performance..\n.I worked with a fairly complex http api app that ran as a rather svelte wsgi framework under gunicorn, and we saw at least 10x or more increase in memory usage than cpython when we switched to pypy, once the jit was fully warmed up (memory usage seemed to hit steady state after about an hour). pypy has also historically (in my experience) been a bit more \"lazy\" (deferring GC of individual objects longer) than cpython when an object falls out of scope..My general rule of thumb for pypy has historically been that you trade memory (requires more of it) for speed (faster) when compared against cpython..Maybe the reimplementation itself was just far more efficient? Hopefully the talk itself clarified that point. I would be very interested in hearing more about that particular aspect..\n.\n.PyPy using less memory than Go does seem weird but depending on how much the GCs differ and how they are configured it could simply be that Go's GC doesn't give up memory as freely to the OS..\n.The JIT memory is constant at runtime (proportional(-ish) to the amount of code, which is fixed) while it is desirable to have the number of coroutines be as large as possible..\n.It can take a very long time until the memory consumed by the JIT actually remains constant. If you do continuous integration and deploy several times per day, your application might never reach that point..\n.\n.\n.\n.D in particular seems like it would be the logical upgrade path from python or ruby. it has a comfortably familiar C lineage, supports a variety of programming paradigms, and has good concurrency support. i wonder why people don't at least give it a look. (personal experience - i tried to use it twice, several years ago, and gave up because the tooling was bad, but from what i've heard that's very much improved today).\n.D is the sweet spot for Python programmers to upgrade to without going backwards to Go (Programming language design wise) nor weighed down by all the new (and very good) stuff in Rust..D has everything from a nice IDE(Xamarin Studio), debugger, package management (Dub), statically compiled binaries, pretty decent std lib (not as good as python or Go, but very good nonetheless)..I still write Python if it's a \"script\" that has to run on a $work server, where it is safe to assume that Python would be available and sufficient for most tasks..\n.Are you quite sure that all those bells and whistles, all those wonderful facilities of your so called powerful programming languages, belong to the solution set rather than the problem set?.\n.Why aren't you using ALGOL?.\n.\n.\"In December 1968 the report on the Algorithmic language ALGOL 68 was published. On 20–24 July 1970 a working conference was arranged by the IFIP to discuss the problems of implementation of the language,[1] a small team from the Royal Radar Establishment attended to present their compiler, written by I.F. Currie, Susan G. Bond[2] and J.D. Morrison. In the face of estimates of up to 100 man-years to implement the language, using up to 7 pass compilers they described how they had already implemented a one-pass compiler which was in production use in engineering and scientific applications.\".cf. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.That split doesn't forbid reading the module metada..\n.\n.What i agree on:.What i agree on with the presentation: Concurrency using goroutines and channels is f... hard besides very primitive scenarios. Even fork-join isn't that easy. There also the lack of expressiveness hurts: It's nearly impossible to build higher level abstractions above the channels/goroutines. You always have to do the bookkeeping of your goroutines..I also agree on the error-handling problems: It's often hard to locate errors. It requires a big amount of discipline by the programmers to achieve some kind of ability to locate errors. No, i don't want the Java/C#-'i throw exceptions everywhere'-style back, but  Go is the other extreme. Some more lightweight-panic wouldn't be bad..What i can't agree on:.That you cannot mock without interfaces in Go is typically not a problem: There is no real encapsulation (_, ., no constructors) so in many cases you just an instantiate your structs as you need them. The classic for mocking - time - is problematic as in every language. IO is typically behind the various io.Reader/Writer... interfaces: No problems there..The criticism about memory consumption i don't get: Every system i saw ported to go from Java, Ruby or Python had a much lower memory footprint than before. And typically go allows to optimize allocation quite well when needed..\n.I'm using a small utility library to wrap the original error and add function name, line, file name and optionally a descriptive message that explains what failed..\n.This was my point: In many areas go forces the developer to the right thing (no unnecessary imports, gofmt...) and does not rely on developers discipline. But when i comes to error handling it does..What i would wish for is some extended error handling supported by the compiler. I don't want a stack trace, but the compiler easily could produce for example a line number where the error was returned..\n.\n.\n.- CI system detects a commit and checks out the latest code.- CI system makes a virtualenv and sets up the project and its dependencies into it with \"pip install --editable path/to/checkout\".- CI system runs tests, computes coverage, etc..- CI system makes a output directory and populates it with \"pip wheel --wheel-dir path/to/output path/to/checkout\".- Deployment system downloads wheels to a temporary location.- Deployment system makes a virtualenv in the right location.- Deployment system populates virtualenv with \"pip install --no-deps path/to/temp/location/*.whl\".The target node only needs a compatible build of python and the virtualenv package installed; it doesn't need a compiler and only needs a network connection if you want to transfer wheel files that way..\n.Really nice stuff.\n.Considering I'd have to write a build script to use Platter, it didn't seem like it would be a lot of work to write a few extra lines and not require an additional dependency..\n.- go get.- go test.- go build.- copy to target.It's possible with Python, it's easier with Go. It's a place where we could use a lot of progress..\n.build.sh.Once you'd done the up-front work of figuring out how to do deployment sanely, it became equally easy for both of you..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.This bakes a whole virtualenv with all python dependencies (including compiled C libraries) into a .deb package. The packages tend to be big-ish (3MB to 15MB), but the target system only needs the right python version, nothing else..\n.\n.\n.Yes, it helps. But you can use Docker with Go programs as well (and drop a lot more of the base image in the process)..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.So as someone who is clearly in no position to be criticizing other projects yet, isn't Heka exactly the sort of project you shouldn't do in Go? I say that because I have the feeling you should use Go only for very concrete cases, given its lack of proper abstractions..I.e. writing a tool that receives log lines over HTTP, extracts metrics and forwards those to StatsD? Perfect use case for Go. But writing a tool that lets you plug in arbitrary frontends to forwards to arbitrary backends? Perhaps they got it to work nice, but that sounds more like a case for a more general language..\n.Go shouldn't have \"use cases\". One should be able to do almost everything with ease with a language built in 2008/9..And unfortunatly that is not the case. Go has excellent concurrency features, but is limited by dumb language design decisions which make it painfull to test and to write good reusable and composable libraries for..I'd love to replace my entire stack with Go but I can't. Something I would write in Ruby in 10 days takes 2 months in Go. And worse, I cant write the code the exact way I want which does piss me off. Give me some choice, not random constraints. Aside from concurrency , I shouldn't have to ask myself how I write something in a specific language. This is the goal of refactoring, and it comes later..I will personnally invest in Crystal and dump Go as soon as it runs on Windows. It has channels, and that's all I need..\n.Have you looked into Elixir? It has Ruby like syntax, but uses an actor model for concurrency(it runs off of the Erlang VM). For handling concurrent tasks it tends to benchmark around Go's speed, but is much nicer to do things in. While it is admittedly immature, the ecosystem still has a decent amount of packages and the tooling isn't bad..\n.\n.Assuming that Go is a general-purpose high-level language, yes, but is it?  It was created to replace C++ in critical infrastructure, not Python/Ruby as the end-all be-all of default platforms for every situation.  Its syntax simplicity and speed absolutely makes it attractive to a wider audience, sure, but if it does the job it was designed to do very well, should we be angry that it doesn't do all jobs well?.Developer time and execution time are both important metrics when considering a language, and Go is very well situated when the major developer time gains offset the minor execution time losses vs C/C++.  That it's less well situated when the developer time losses vs Python/Ruby are incurred on a project when the execution time gains are irrelevant isn't a failing of the language, it's a trade-off..\n.Note: I gave this talk..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.I look at Ruby or Go... or even Java and every new language feature has a much more rapider adoption curve..is this a pretty solid statement that the entire Python 3 + asyncio path is a dead end ?.\n.I certainly wouldn't call the Python 3 path \"dead\", as starting a new project you'd be silly not to use Python 3.  It's just a very slow process..Also, porting from 2 to 3 isn't even that hard (there's a script that does 95% of it for you)..\n.I'm not sure if  you have worked in the Ruby or Go ecosystem... but if you are starting a new project, you are using latest Ruby+latest Rails. this is not the case in Python. I asked a question here and on the /r/python forums. What framework should one use to build an API using asyncio+postgresql. Nobody seems to be doing it..the answers I got mentioned using Tornado with Python 3 code on top of it..People have compared asyncio with goroutines - but even for a project that is a migration from Go -> Python by a fairly advanced developer ... Py 2.7 is being used..\n.That's just FUD, it might have been true many years ago but not any longer. ., there are a few red holes but from what I could tell some of those have substitutes that in many cases are better even. It might also be true for in house libraries but at least there you have the chance to upgrade yourself..\n.the ecosystem is still running 2.7. I cant wait to switch to Py3..\n.Which one? Pyramid and SQLAlchemy work like a charm in Py3. Until you really name what your need is, that's just fud..\n.I hope that PyPy will have a Py3.5 compatible interpreter someday, but CPython is good enough for now..\n.\n.\n.if Pypy + asyncio was available, would you have built everything using that stack ? There have been all these benchmarks that asyncio is so much slower than threads [1] \nHow would you compare that with Go ?.[1] .\n.\n.\n.I do like Rust, but must we clutter . Go-related thread with comments about it? The zealousness is annoying..\n.\n.\n.\n.The constant conflict might be annoying but using Rust or even C++ would certainly be a very reasonable choice..\n.\n.The problem was pretty simple: pull event messages from AMQP and then shove them into elastic search and file system. Heka and Flume were both sort of overkill so I decided to write it in Rust. I got extremely far but alas there were some issues with the Elastic Search Rust library that I'm still resolving. Surprisingly the AMQP library worked pretty well..I will vouch for the OP's point on error handling as Rust has a similar issue to Golang but not as bad because of the awesome type system (still I hate to admit but I really miss exceptions at times)..Anyway to relate again to the OP I went back to what I know best.. boring ass Java and wrote the app in a hour or so. It took about the same memory as Heka (surprising since its Java) and appeared to be slightly faster than Heka (elastic search indexing became the bottleneck for both so take that with a grain of salt)..Long story short.. I think the drivers and libraries really are the deal breakers and not so much the languages themselves (with some minor exceptions like the GIL)..\n.(slide 20).I find that a weird sentence in an otherwise carefully written article. The author is talking about writing software which does a lot of socket IO. So I would expect the performance discussion to make some reference to this; I assume what he's talking about in the quote is the behavior of pure CPU-bound code but he doesn't discuss to what extent this is really relevant to his project..\n.\n.1. Goroutine memory use - Post happens to be about 1.2 and 1.4 and I started with 1.5..2. Debugging - yes handling errors are a bit tedious. I have not written much boilerplate to handle errors. I just copy error handlers a lot. Maybe that’s why error strings are a lot common..3. Goroutine leaks - This is scary, I have used goroutines with channels but properly so far. Yes you can write code that leaks. This is something you will have to check yourself..4.Testing - not done much..Overall - I feel author learned of some negative aspects about Go and turned away. Some of them like Goroutine memory footrpint will improve with time (e.g. 1.5 earned a lot of praise for GC improvement). A lot places author mentions possible improvements for e.g godebug or latest Go with SSL but did not try it as much. So it may not be as relevant to new Go adopters..\n.Big statement, anyone confirm this?.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.On a network bound daemon, which is not CPU-bound, the GIL is really not an issue, so it never came up..\n.\n.\n.There is only one case where the serialized runtime presents a problem, and that is in CPU-bound 90s-style shared memory parallel computation that the industry as a whole has been trying to escape for the past 20 years, because thinking about individual threads and the lifetimes of shared memory allocations turned out to be an incredibly shitty abstraction..Even if you want to shoot yourself in the foot, both Python and Node.js provide facilities to allow e.g. concurrent array access (in Python via the multiprocessing package). The reason those approaches aren't more popular in those languages is exactly because the . is defective. Anyone worth their salt working in a computation-heavy domain stopped writing explicit threading code a long time ago..\n.\n.\n.\n.If I can't get a nuanced presentation out of a slide deck, then maybe an article or corresponding speech is required!.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.Gratz. Next time, use C. PyPy won't solve your problem. You're writing a low latency, high performance, large throughput, super-optimized message router. Even the libs you like in Cpython are.. freaking C. Do you know why? Do you understand what happens underneath the language? Do you know why PyPy is faster?.Don't get me wrong - and in fact, maybe you get me right:.Go rocks. Python rocks. It's just not the tool for that very job. Today, it's still freaking C..\n",

        "This guide shows you how to get started writing Python programs for your Vernier Go Direct. sensors. The guide contains the following topics:.If you are new to Python you should look over all of the steps. If you are familiar with Python you might just focus on installing the godirect module and downloading the examples.. Go Direct spectrometers are not supported..We have developed a Python module called . that allows you to communicate with Vernier Go Direct sensors via USB or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This requires the following:.The godirect module is designed to work with Python 3, it is not compatible with Python 2. In some cases, Python is pre-installed and shipped with your operating system. Use the following steps to check for Python 3 on your machine, and to install Python 3 if needed:.With Python installed, you need to choose an application that you will use to write and run your Python programs. You can write your programs in a simple text or code editor, or you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE is a software application that provides all of the tools to write, comment, edit, debug, develop and run software programs. Python has an IDE bundled with it called IDLE that is cross-platform, and suitable for beginners. If you are new to Python and programming, we recommend that you start with this tool..Later, you may want to research the various IDEs, learn about the different features, and give one a try. For example, Visual Studio Code is a free IDE available for Windows, Linux, and Mac. There are many other choices, and you can find more information at python.org.Once you have Python 3 installed, you will use a tool called . (a Python 3 package manager) to install the godirect module and other Python modules that you may need. Python automatically includes ., so this tool is ready to use. Note that we will be using the . command, rather than just ., to ensure that the Vernier files will be associated with Python 3, and not Python 2..The . commands are executed by running them in your operating systems’ tool for executing commands (Powershell, Command Prompt, or Terminal window). There are slight differences in the required steps to install the godirect module for Windows, macOs, and Linux (including Linux running on Raspberry Pi). Follow the steps outlined below for your platform..Run the following command in Powershell or Command Prompt to install the godirect module for USB and BLE:.If you received an error during the installation of godirect, part of which looks like the message below, it is probably because your Windows system does not have the appropriate compiler. The godirect module includes a package that requires a C++ compiler..In order to install without this failure, you will need to follow the instructions to download and install the .. The latest version of the tools download can be found by scrolling down to the All Downloads section and expanding Tools for Visual Studio (as shown in the figure below). After completing the installation of this tool repeat the . installation steps for godirect and Bleak..Run the following command in Terminal to install the godirect module for USB and BLE:.Run the following command in your terminal to install the godirect module for USB and BLE:.Some Linux distributions will not include all of the tools required by the godirect module and its dependencies. If you see errors when you run the . install, you might need to first install the two packages as shown below, before trying again:.In order to communicate with Go Direct devices over USB on Linux systems, you will need to provide a special udev rule that allows the device to be identified when it is plugged in. The rule file is located on our github directory. Use the following steps to download the rule file and then move it to the proper location:.If you wish to connect to Go Direct device using a ., rather than the native BLuetooth radio, you will need to install the vernierpygatt module with this command:.You will also need to pass . into the godirect module. There is a comment regarding this in the . function in the gdx.py file..At this point, you should have Python 3 installed and have the godirect module installed. Before moving to examples, confirm the installation of the godirect module by showing the version information. Run the following command in the terminal:.Running the . command will provide information about the installed package, including the version number. \nShould you need to update to a newer version in the future, run the following command in the terminal:.With the godirect module installed, it is time to run an example..The getting started examples demonstrate how to collect data from Go Direct sensors. Under the hood, these examples all use the godirect module to communicate with the Go Direct devices. However, to make things a bit simpler, we created a layer to abstract some of the details away and provide some simple functions. That layer is named gdx and can be found in the /gdx/ folder (note that this folder must be located in the same directory as the examples or programs that you write that use the gdx functions). All of the getting started examples make use of this layer for a cleaner, simpler entry point into coding with Go Direct devices..The gdx functions used in a typical program to collect data include:.A simple program using the gdx module looks like this:.Here is some more information about the gdx functions, including how you might add arguments to a few of the functions:.As stated earlier, these gdx functions are available in the gdx.py file, in the gdx folder. The gdx.py file is easy to locate and available for you to modify. Consider adding your own functions, or modifying the functions to meet your needs..This is a known incompatibility and the options to work around it are described here: https://github.com/hbldh/bleak/issues/147.All of the content in this repository is available under the terms of the ...Vernier products are designed for educational use.

        "Today we're going to make a Python library that is actually the Go webserver, for which we can write handlers in Python. It makes Python servers really fast, and—more importantly—it’s a bit fun and experimental. This post is a more detailed overview of my .. If you'd like to play along at home, this code was written in Go 1.6 and Python 3.5 and the entire complete working thing is open source (MIT license) and and ...First, a refresher:.That's right..Want to give it a try . Hit this shiny button:.At first, Go was created to be run as a single statically linked binary process. Later, more . were added to let us compile Go as dynamically linked binaries. In Go 1.5, additional modes were added to allow us to build Go code into shared library that is runnable from other runtimes..Just like how all kinds of Python modules like lxml use C to run super-optimized code, you can now run Go code just the same. More or less..Before throwing everything away and starting fresh using this newfound power, there are some challenges that need to be considered..When a Go library is used from another runtime, it spins up the Go runtime in parallel with the caller's runtime (if any). That is, it gets the goroutine threads and the garbage collector and all that other nice stuff that would normally be initialized up when running a  Go program on its own..This is different than calling vanilla C code because technically there is no innate C runtime. There is no default worker pools, no default garbage collector. You might call a C library which has its own equivalents of this, then all bets are off, but in most simple cases you get very little overhead when calling C functions. This is something to consider when calling out to code that requires its own runtime..Moving memory (or objects) between runtimes can be tricky and dangerous, especially when garbage collectors are involved. Both Go and Python have their own garbage collector. If you share the same memory pointer between the two runtimes, one garbage collector might decide that it's no longer used and reclaim the memory while the other runtime would be all \"WHY'D YOU DO THAT??\" and crash. Or worse, it could try to move it around, or change the memory's layout in a way that the runtimes disagree, then we'd get weird hard-to-diagnose heisenbugs..The safest thing to do is to copy data across boundaries when possible, or treat it as immutable read-only data when it's too big to be copied..When mediating calls between two runtimes like Go and Python, we use C in between them as a kind of demilitarized zone, because C has no runtime and we can trust it to not mess with our data all willy nilly..In this proof-of-concept, we use the Go webserver, but we want to provide a Python handler that will get called when our route gets hit..Make a Go webserver, easy peasy..Make it into a module that is exported into a C shared library..Add a handler registry bridge in C..Add some helpers for calling Go interface functions from C..Add headers for importing the shared library in Python..Write our handler to use the C registry bridge in Python, and the helpers to\ninteract with the data to create a response..Let's explore how to call C from Go and Go from C..Calling C from Go is about as easy as it gets. In fact, we can embed C code in a comment right above an . statement and the Go compiler will build and link it for us..We use the magic . namespace to access anything from the world of C, even if it's not inlined directly above it. We can . things as we normally would, too, to import code from whichever other C files we would like to use..Additional reading material:.To call Go from C, we'll need to compile our Go code as a shared object and import it. To identify which Go API we want to expose in C, we export it explicitly with an . comment directive..Three things about this code snippet:.We need to make sure that the interface for the exported function is properly laden with C types. That means inputs and outputs all need to be C types, and our Go code will cast in and out of them as needed..Our shared object needs to be . and have an empty . function. Part of the process for CGO building into a shared library is creating an injection point for spawning the Go runtime..There are many nuances regarding passing memory from Go to C which are not expressed in this basic example. You can learn more on that in the links at the end of the section..This will create a . shared object and a corresponding . header file that we can reference from our C code..Now we'll make our C code in a different directory and bring in the . and . files there..Success! We called Go code from C..More specific reading in the aforementioned links:.Now onto the Python side of this business. Same idea, so let's look at how to call Python from C and C from Python..There are two approaches to calling C from Python..One method is using . which lets us dive in with no additional dependencies. This works by explicitly defining all of the necessary headers and stubs that Python needs to figure out how to call the C code..The other method is using ., which automatically generates all of the headers and stubs for us. We'll explore the CFFI method for the sake of convenience..Calling the CFFI file will generate the necessary boilerplate for calling this corresponding C code from Python..Now to call it from Python, we'll need two more files: . and an empty . (because Python)..Here we go:.Success: we called C from Python!.This was cheating a bit, in the same way we cheated in the Go version because the C was embedded inside of Python code. But, it's not that far from a real world scenario: We could just as easily . our way into all kinds of external C logic, even if that part is embedded..There are other ways of doing this too, ., but this will do for now..The full source code with Python and C examples of gohttplib is available on Github: .We're going to fly through the important bits really fast to get the idea of how it works and how to run it on Heroku..Let's break it down..We're exporting two functions into the C API:.Note that the exported functions all take in . types, because they'll be called from the C side of things..There is a tricky bit here: The . callback function pointer accepts two parameters: . and .. This isn't going to fly for two reasons. The first parameter is a Go interface and both C and Python have no idea what those are. The second parameter is a pointer to an instance which we can't share across the runtime boundary, because that's a big no-no (see the Considerations section)..For the . data structure, we make a C equivalent (.), populate it by copying the necessary values, and pass it forward instead..For the . interface, we work around it by creating additional exported shims in Go. These shims call the interface's function in Go on behalf of C (more on that in a moment)..There is one more weird trick here: We need to pass some kind of reference to whichever interface instance we're talking about, get that back, and call the original interface without passing any memory pointers across the runtime. How do we do that safely? With our own pointer registry!.There are three operations we care about, each one is just a couple of lines that saves a key in a lookup and the reverse..Now rather than passing in the entire . interface instance, we can register it in our pointer registry and pass along the id which will later come back to us. This is nice and safe because nothing outside of the Go runtime can modify the original memory space, all it can do is hang onto some opaque integer and hand it back later..Let's take a quick look at our interface shims:.Now, given our proxied pointer ID in C, we'll be able to call Write and WriteHeader on the underlying ResponseWriter that continues to live in Go. We could expand this to cover the full interface but, for the sake of our prototype, these two will do..Let's skip the CFFI boilerplate we've seen before and dive right into our C-to-Python wrapper:.Just like we made C-friendly wrappers around Go's . and ., here we're making Python-friendly wrappers around C's . struct and . interface shims we made. All of this is just to hide CFFI's warts and make the exposed API somewhat idiomatic..The final trick is converting our Python callback handler function into a C function pointer that can be passed back to Go. Luckily, CFFI has a convenient . decorator which does all the nasty work for us..Off to the races we go!.It's fun to take a look at the performance characteristics of this kind of approach. Yes, yes, of course, this isn't . or anything, but for the sake of some laughs:.Conditions: . doing 10,000 requests with 10 concurrency on my 💻. If you want to see how it stands up on Heroku dynos, just hit the deploy button and see how it works for you:.These are all basic \"Hello, world\\n\" handlers. The first one is straight-up Go, then it's Go-to-C, then it's Go-to-C-to-Python (gohttp-python). It does pretty well. .Keep in mind that this is with 10 concurrent requests, so werkzeug-flask probably chokes more on the concurrency than the response time being slow..Again, this is for-fun off-the-cuff unscientific lolbenchmarks..We've discussed 80% of what's involved, but the remaining 80% is still available as an exercise for the reader (or maybe a future blog post):. is where you can see more fun experiments by me, and . is me on Twitter.. is the source code for this project..More posts on this topic:.Automagic code generating:.\n    Browse the archives for\n    .\n    or\n    .\n.\n    Subscribe to the RSS feed for\n    .\n    or\n    ..\n  ",

        " Some kind folks have suggested changes on the implementations\nto make them more idiomatic, so the code here may differ from what’s currently in the\nrepos..A few years ago, I was tasked with rewriting an image processing service. To tell\nwhether my new service was creating the same output as the old given an image and one or\nmore transforms (resize, make a circular crop, change formats, etc.), I had to inspect\nthe images myself. Clearly I needed to automate this, but I could find no existing\nPython library that simply told me how different two images were on a per-pixel basis.\nHence ., which can give you a difference\nratio/percentage, or generate a diff image (check out the readme to see an example)..The initial implementation was in Python (the language I’m most comfortable in), with\nthe heavy lifting done by\n.. It’s usable as a library or a\ncommand line tool. The actual\n. of the\nprogram is very small, only a few dozen lines, thanks to Pillow. Not a lot of effort\nwent into building this tool (., there’s a Python\nmodule for nearly everything), but it’s at least been useful for a few dozen people\nother than myself..A few months ago, I joined a company that had several services written in Go, and I\nneeded to get up to speed quickly on the language. Writing\n. seemed like a fun and possibly\neven useful way to do this. Here are a few points of interest that came out of the\nexperience, along with some that came up while using it at work:.(Again, the code: . (python) and\n.).: Go only has . which are similar to Python’s\nkeyword arguments, but less useful, since the arguments need to be of the same type. I\nfound keyword arguments to be something I really missed, mainly for how much easier\nrefactoring is if you can just throw a . of any type onto whatever function\nneeds it without having to rewrite every one of its calls. I use this feature quite\noften in my work, it’s saved me a lot of time over the years. Not having the feature\nmade my implementation for how to handle whether or not the diff image should be\ncreated based on the command line flags somewhat clumsy..: Go is a bit more verbose (though not Java verbose). Part of that is\nbecause type system does not have generics, but mainly the fact that the language\nitself is very small and not heavily loaded with features (you only get .). I missed having Python’s list\ncomprehensions and other functional programming features. If you’re comfortable\nwith Python, you can go through the . in\na day or two, and you’ll have been exposed to the entirety of the language..: Python has exceptions, whereas Go propagates errors by returning\ntuples: . from functions wherever something may go wrong. Python lets\nyou catch errors at any point in the call stack as opposed to requiring you to\nmanually pass them back up over and over again. This again results in brevity and\ncode that isn’t littered with Go’s infamous . pattern, though you do\nneed to be aware of what possible exceptions can be thrown by a function and all(!) of\nits internal calls (using . is a usually-bad-practice workaround for\nthis).  Good docstrings and tests can help here, which you should be writing in either\nlanguage.  Go’s system is definitely safer. You’re still allowed to shoot yourself in\nthe foot by ignoring the . value, but the system makes it obvious that this is a\nbad idea..: Prior to .,\nGo’s package manager would just throw all downloaded packages into .\ninstead of the project’s directory (like most other languages). The path for these\nmodules inside . would also be built from the URL where the package is hosted,\nso your import would look something like ..\nEmbedding . inside the source code of almost all Go codebases seems like a\nstrange choice. In any case, Go now allows the conventional way of doing things, but\nGo modules are still new so this quirk will remain common in wild Go code for some\ntime..: Goroutines are a very convenient way to fire off asynchronous\ntasks. Before ., Python’s asynchronous solutions were somewhat hairy.\nUnfortunately I haven’t written much real-world async code in Python or Go, and the\nsimplicity of . didn’t seem to lend itself to the added overhead of\nasynchronicity, so I don’t have too much to say here, though I do like Go’s\n. as a way to handle multiple async tasks.\nMy understanding is that for performance, Go still has the upper hand here as\ngoroutines can make use of full multiprocessor parallelism, where Python’s basic\n. is still stuck on one processor, so mainly useful for I/O bound tasks..My initial impression of Go is that because its ability to abstract is (purposely)\nlimited, it’s not as . a language as Python is. Python has more features and thus\nmore ways of doing something, and it can be a lot of fun to find the fastest, most\nreadable, or “cleverest” solution. Go actively tries to stop you from being “clever.” I\nwould go as far as saying that Go’s strength is that it’s . clever..Its minimalism and lack of freedom are constraining as a single developer just trying to\nmaterialize an idea. However, this weakness becomes its strength when the project scales\nto dozens or hundreds of developers - because everyone’s working with the same small\ntoolset of language features, it’s more likely to be uniform and thus understandable by\nothers. It’s still very possible to write bad Go, but it’s more difficult to create\nmonstrosities that more “powerful” languages will let you produce..After using it for a while, it makes sense to me why a company like Google would want a\nlanguage like this. New engineers are being introduced to enormous codebases constantly,\nand in a messier/more powerful language and under the pressure of deadlines, complexity\ncould be introduced faster than it can be removed. The best way to prevent that is with\na language that has less capacity for it..With that said, I’m happy to work on a Go codebase in the context of a large application\nwith a diverse and ever-growing team. In fact, I think I’d prefer it. I just have no\ndesire to use it for my own personal projects..A few weeks ago, I decided to give an honest go at learning Rust. I had attempted to do\nso before but found the type system and borrow checker confusing and without enough\ncontext for why all these constraints were being forced on me, cumbersome for the tasks\nI was trying to do. However, since then, I’ve learned a bit more about what happens with\nmemory during the execution of a program. I also started with . instead of just attempting to dive in headfirst.\nThis was massively helpful, and probably the best introduction to any programming\nlanguage I’ve ever experienced..After I had gone through the first dozen or so chapters of the book, I felt confident\nenough to try another implementation of . (at this point, I had about as much\nexperience with Rust as I’d had with Go when I wrote .). It took me a bit\nlonger to write than the Go implementation, which itself took longer than Python. I\nthink this would be true even taking into account my greater comfort with Python -\nthere’s just more to write in both languages..Some of the things that I took notice of when writing\n.:.: Rust strongly encourages a functional approach: it has a\nFP-friendly type system like Haskell, immutable types, closures, iterators, pattern\nmatching, and more, but also allows imperative code. It’s similar to writing OCaml\n(interestingly, the original Rust compiler .).\nBecause of this, code is more concise than you’d expect for a language that competes\nwith C..: Instead of the exception model that Python uses or the tuple\nreturns that Go uses for error handling, Rust makes use of its enumerated types:\n. returns either . or .. This is closer to Go’s way if you\nsquint, but is a bit more explicit and leverages the type system. There’s also\nsyntactic sugar for checking a statement for an . and returning early: . (Go could use something like this, IMO)..: Async/await hasn’t quite landed for Rust yet, but the final syntax\nhas .. Rust also has some basic\nthreading features in the standard library that seem a bit easier to use than\nPython’s, but I haven’t spent much time with it. Go still seems to have the best\nofferings here..: . and . are extremely polished implementations of a\nlanguage version manager and package/module manager, respectively. Everything “just\nworks.” I especially love the autogenerated docs. The Python options for these are\nsomewhat organic and finicky, and as I mentioned before, Go has a strange way of\nmanaging modules, though aside from that, its tooling is in a much better state than\nPython’s..: My . is embarrassingly large, with at least three dozen\nplugins. I have some plugins for linting, autocompleting, and formatting both Python\nand Go, but the Rust plugins were easier to set up, more helpful, and more consistent\ncompared to the other two languages. The\n. and\n. plugins (along with .) were all I needed to get an\nextremely powerful configuration. I haven’t tested out other editors with Rust but\nwith the excellent editor-agnostic tooling that Rust comes with, I’d expect them to be\njust as helpful. The setup provides the best go-to-definition I’ve ever used. It works\nperfectly on local, standard library, and third-party code out of the box..I definitely wouldn’t recommend attempting to write Rust without at least\ngoing through the first few chapters of the book, even if you’re already familiar with C\nand memory management. With Go and Python, as long as you have some experience with\nanother modern imperative programming language, they’re not difficult to just start\nwriting, referring to the docs when necessary. Rust is a large language.  Python also\nhas a lot of features, but they’re mostly opt-in. You can get a lot done just by\nunderstanding a few primitive data structures and some builtin functions. With Rust, you\nreally need to understand the complexity inherent to the type system and borrow checker,\nor you’re going to be getting tangled up a lot..As far as how I feel when I write Rust, it’s a lot of fun, like Python. Its breadth of\nfeatures makes it very expressive. While the compiler stops you a lot, it’s also very\nhelpful, and its suggestions on how to solve your borrowing/typing problems usually\nwork. The tooling as I’ve mentioned is the best I’ve encountered for any language and\ndoesn’t bring me a lot of headaches like some other languages I’ve used. I really like\nusing the language and will continue to look for opportunities to do so, where the\nperformance of Python isn’t good enough..I’ve extracted the chunks of each . which calculate the difference ratio.  To\nsummarize how it works for Python, this takes the diff image generated by Pillow, sums\nthe values of all channels of all pixels, and returns the ratio produced by dividing the\nmaximum possible value (a pure white image of the same size) by this sum..:.For Go and Rust, the method is a little different: Instead of creating a diff image, we\njust loop over both input images and keep a running sum of the differences of each\npixel. In Go, we’re indexing into each image by coordinate….:.… but in Rust, we’re treating the images as what they really are in memory, a series\nof bytes that we can just zip together and consume..:.Some things to take note of in these examples:.This snippet gives you some insight into how much language-specific knowledge you’ll\nneed to pick up to be effective in Rust..Now for something resembling a scientific comparison. I first generated three random\nimages of different sizes: 1x1, 2000x2000, and 10,000x10,000. Then I measured each\n(language, image size) combination’s performance 10 times for each . ratio\ncalculation and averaged them, using the values given by the . values from the\n. command. . was built using ., . with just ., and the Python . invoked with .. The results, on a\n2015 Macbook Pro:.I’m losing a lot of precision because . only goes down to 10ms resolution (one more\ndigit is shown here because of the averaging). The task only requires a very specific\ntype of calculation as well, so a different or more complex one could have very\ndifferent numbers.  Despite these caveats, we can still learn something from the data..With the 1x1 image, virtually all the time is spent in setup, not ratio calculation.\nRust wins, despite using two third-party libraries\n(. and .)\nand Go only using the standard library. I’m not surprised Python’s startup is as slow as\nit is, since importing a large library (Pillow) is one of its steps, and even just . takes 0.030s..At 2000x2000, the gap narrows for both Go and Python compared to Rust, presumably\nbecause less of the overall time is spent in setup compared to calculation. However,\nat 10,000x10,000, Rust is more performant in comparison, which I would guess is due to\nits compiler’s optimizations producing the smallest block of machine code that is looped\nthrough 100,000,000 times, dwarfing the setup time. Never needing to pause for garbage\ncollection could also be a factor..The Python implementation definitely has room for improvement, because as efficient as\nPillow is, we’re still creating a diff image in memory (traversing both input images)\nand . adding up each of its pixel’s channel values. A more direct approach like the\nGo and Rust implementations would probably be marginally faster. However, a .\nPython implementation would be wildly slower, since Pillow does its main work in C.\nBecause the other two are pure language implementations, this isn’t really a fair\ncomparison, though in some ways it is, because Python has an absurd amount of libraries\navailable to you that are performant thanks to C extensions (and Python and C have a\nvery tight relationship in general)..I should also mention the binary sizes: Rust’s is 2.1mb with the . build, and\nGo’s is comparable at 2.5mb. Python doesn’t create binaries, but . files are\n. comparable, and .’s . files are about 3kb in total. Its source\ncode is also only about 3kb, but including the Pillow dependency, it weighs in at\n24mb(!). Again, not a fair comparison because I’m using a third party imaging library,\nbut it should be mentioned..Obviously, these are three very different languages fulfilling different niches. I’ve\nheard Go and Rust often mentioned together, but I think Go and Python are the two more\nsimilar/competing languages. They’re both good for writing server-side application logic\n(what I spend most of my time doing at work). Comparing just native code performance, Go\nblows Python away, but many of Python’s libraries that require speed are wrappers around\nfast C implementations - in practice, it’s more complicated than a naive comparison.\nWriting a C extension for Python doesn’t really count as Python anymore (and then you’ll\nneed to know C), but the option is open to you..For your backend server needs, Python has proven itself to be “fast enough” for\nmost applications, though if you need more performance, Go has it. Rust even more so,\nbut you pay for it with development time. Go is not far off from Python in this regard,\nthough it certainly is slower to develop, primarily due to its small feature set. Rust\nis very fully featured, but managing memory will always take more time than having the\nlanguage do it, and this outweighs having to deal with Go’s minimality..It should also be mentioned that there are many, many Python developers in the world,\nsome with literally decades of experience. It will likely never be hard to find more\npeople with language experience to add to your backend team if you choose Python.\nHowever, Go developers are not particularly rare, and can easily be created because the\nlanguage is so easy to learn.  Rust developers are both rarer and harder to make since\nthe language takes longer to internalize..With respect to the type systems: static type systems make it easier to write more\ncorrect code, but it’s not a panacea.  You still need to write comprehensive tests no\nmatter the language you use.  It requires a bit more discipline, but I’ve found that the\ncode I write in Python is not necessarily more error prone than Go as long as I’m able\nto write a good suite of tests. That said, I much prefer Rust’s type system to Go’s: it\nsupports generics, pattern matching, handles errors, and just does more for you in\ngeneral..In the end, this comparison is a bit silly, because though the use cases of these\nlanguages overlap, they occupy very different niches. Python is high on the\ndevelopment-speed, low on the performance scale, while Rust is the opposite, and Go is\nin the middle. I enjoy writing Python and Rust more than Go (.),\nthough I’ll continue to use Go at work happily (along with Python) since it really is a\ngreat language for building stable and maintainable applications with many contributors\nfrom many backgrounds. Its inflexibility and minimalism which makes it less enjoyable to\nuse (for me) becomes its strength here. If I had to choose the language for the backend\nof a new web application, it would be Go..I’m pretty satisfied with the range of programming tasks that are covered by these three\nlanguages - there’s virtually no project that one of them wouldn’t be a great choice\nfor.",

        "The Networking and Cryptography library (NaCl pronounced “salt”) is a software library that provides the core operations required to build cryptographic tools. Sodium is a fork of NaCl with an extended API; it’s portable, and binaries are available to be used by various programming languages and operating systems. It comes in the form of a library called ...Although there are several Python and Go cryptography libraries, it is primarily a matter of personal choice which one to use. One advantage of . is that it is available for many languages..Today, we will use . in Python to encrypt messages and decrypt them using . in Go. Let’s get started!.: You can find the code for this project on ...First, if you don’t already have Python on your computer, you’ll need to ...Next, create a directory where all of our future code will go:.To avoid issues running the wrong version of Python and its dependencies, we recommend creating a virtual environment so that the commands . and . run the correct versions:.This creates a directory called . containing the Python binaries and dependencies. The new directory should be added to the . file and then activated for use:.You can run the following command to see which version you are running:.Next, install the PyNaCl library:.Next, if you haven’t already installed Go on your computer you will need to ...Finally, make the directory a Go module and install the Go crypto library:.Public key or asymmetric encryption requires the generation of two numbers called keys. One key is the private key, which only the owner knows. The second key is public; it is published and widely known..A message encrypted using the private key can only be decrypted using the public key. Anyone who possesses the public key can decrypt the message. The public key holder knows the message could only have been encrypted by the private key owner..Conversely, a message encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the private key. You can be sure that only one person can view the message. The strength of the encryption depends on how much “effort” it takes to break the math without access to the decryption key..A secure way of exchanging messages is to use two sets of keys, one for each party involved. Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob and ensure that only Bob can receive it. Bob wants to ensure that only Alice could have sent it. To achieve this, Alice first encrypts the message using her private key, then she encrypts it with Bob’s public key.  To recover the original message, Bob decrypts the message with his private key, and then with Alice’s public key.. The above explanation is simplified slightly. In the example below, Bob’s private key and Alice’s public key are used to generate an encryption key.  The same key is generated using Alice’s private and Bob’s public key, ...The encryption and decryption processes require complex computation. Low-level libraries do exist for doing this, but they are not very convenient to use. Using . greatly simplifies the process..First, we are going to write a Python program to generate public-private key pairs. Create a script called . containing the following code:.The program uses . to generate a key pair. It also uses . to encode the keys as hexadecimal strings for portability. These hexadecimal key strings are written to files using . function. The . function generates a public-private key pair. The . function returns the private key..Libsodium objects have an . function to encode the object. In this case, it uses .. The public key is an attribute on the private key object. The name of the key owner is passed as a command-line argument..Now run the program to generate keys for Alice and Bob:.The files ., ., ., and . should have been created..The message to be encrypted is a text file containing the poem “Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll. The poem itself is somewhat cryptic, as the meaning of the words is open to interpretation! Rather fittingly, “Jabberwocky” was first published in the book ...Download the “Jabberwocky” poem to .:.Libsodium makes it very easy to encrypt messages. It uses a . object constructed from your private key and the recipient’s public key. The box is then used to encrypt a message. Create a file called . with the following content:.We use the names of the sender and the receiver to construct the  . class. . uses the . helper function to read the hexadecimal encoded key from a file. Libsodium .and . objects are constructed from the encoded keys. The . function constructs a . object from the sender’s private key and the recipient’s public key. Then the message is read from a text file as a byte string and is encrypted by the box. The encrypted message is saved to a file for transmission..Note that this generates a 24-byte random, one-time-use number called a . (“Number used ONCE”). The purpose of the nonce is to ensure that if the same message is encrypted more than once, the resulting encrypted message will be different. The nonce forms the first 24 bytes of the encrypted message..Encrypt the poem by running:.We are going to write a simple Go program that can decrypt a message. Create a file named . with the following content:.Go is a strongly typed language, so we have to create 32-byte arrays to store the keys. The . function reads Bob’s private key and Alice’s public key for the files. They are converted from hexadecimal strings into byte arrays and copied into the fixed-length arrays. The . function reads the encrypted message into a byte array. The nonce needs to be separated from the encrypted message and copied into a 24-byte array. The . function performs the decryption and then prints the decrypted message..Run the application to see the poem “Jabberwocky” restored:.Secret-key encryption uses a single key to both encrypt and decrypt a message. It is commonly used as a faster alternative to public-key encryption. The key itself is a fixed-length random number. As there is only a single key, both the sender and recipient need a copy of it. This requires a key exchange which is often performed out of band or by using public-key encryption..We will again encrypt the poem “Jabberwocky,” but this time using secret-key encryption. For convenience, we will again generate and store the key in a file:. Secure key exchange must be used between parties holding any shared secret..Create a file called . with the following content:.This time the constructor creates a random secret key and stores it in a file. The . function uses a . to encrypt the message. Once again a 24-byte nonce is automatically created and prepended to the encrypted message..Run the script to create the key and encrypted message files:.The Go code for decryption is quite simple. Create a file called . containing the following code:.In this case, only the secret key is extracted from the file using the . function. The program reads the encrypted message from a file and extracts the nonce. Finally, the function . decrypts the message using the nonce and the secret key..Run the program to see the “Jabberwocky” poem restored:.NaCl, Libsodium, and the language-specific wrappers around them simplify the process of encrypting and decrypting messages. Most cryptographic libraries provide low-level operations that are complex to use. The box mechanism performs encryption and decryption in a single function call.

        "Reading time: 30 minutes | Coding time: 5 minutes.Reading through the articles on programming languages, you are bound to stumble upon statements similar to the following:.(Aside: Wikipedia pages of individual languages themselves have a bullet titled \"Typing Discipline\" in the sidebox)..Depending upon your programming background and experience, the above statements might either look deceptively simple to read or seem downright counter-intuitive, yet they are the source of some very famous warts in the respective languages..\nA good understanding of the fundamentals behind such statements can help programmers develop more reasonable expectations from the code they write..We begin by defining 4 terms central to the discussion, namely:.The terms grouped are semantically antonyms to each other..\nEach group defines important characteristics of a programming language independent of the other group..Whether a language is statically typed or dynamically typed depends on how the compiler/interpreter handles variables and at what point during the execution of the program..In a statically typed language, the variable itself has a type; if you have a variable that's an integer, you won't be able to assign any other type of value to it later. Some statically typed languages require you to write out the types of all your variables, while others will deduce many of them for you automatically..Moreover, the compiler can tell which the . of a variable, without executing the program..In a dynamically typed language, a variable is simply a value bound to a name; the value(or object) has a type -- like \"integer\" or \"string\" or \"list\" -- but the variable itself doesn't. We can have a variable which, right now, holds a number, and later assign a string to it..The programmer is free to bind names to different objects with a different type. So long as you only perform operations valid for the type the interpreter doesn't care what type they are..At present, almost all programming languages support only static or dynamic typing, or they favor one of them..Dynamic and static typing have different costs and benefits. Picking the best one for a particular task is not always easy..Static typing has the following main benefits:.Dynamic typing has a different, complementary set of benefits:.The benefits of static typing are more pronounced for large and complex programs. It offers little benefit over dynamic typing when writing short scripts and prototypes, for example. In these cases, it mainly slows down the programmer and dynamic typing is preferable.. The type of name . is the type of the object it refers to at that particular instant. Moreover, no further restriction is laid on it with regards to what values it can/cannot hold in the future.. A compile-time assignment error is raised. Once a type is associated with a variable, the variable cannot hold a value of other data types.. Same as Python.The distinction between such typing comes to the fore when we write programming statements which involve operating values of different ...To resolve the error raised in a strongly typed language, the programmer needs to explicitly convert the type of values to the desired type..The terms \"strong\" and \"weak\" are themselves relative by nature. Thus, a person calls some programming language \"X\" as strongly (or weakly) typed is subjective. From the First Principles perspective, what the person wants to claim is that language \"X\" enforces type checks before performing any operations. Every developer will have a different measure of how rigorous these checks are..Rule of Thumb: the more type coercions (implicit conversions) for built-in operators the language offers, the weaker the typing. (This could also be viewed as more built-in overloading of built-in operators.).\ni.e a strongly typed language is restrictive of type intermingling..Let us understand this distinction with 2 operations which every programmer must have comes across:.Strong Typing:.Weak Typing :.Hence weakly typed languages helps in faster application development and more expressiveness of programming logic (like ad hoc-polymorphism, mix-ins) than strongly typed.. Raises errors when sense cannot be made. Also, the interpreter is not restrictive enough to spoil the fun in programming.. In both the cases, an \"invalid operation\" compile-time error is raised.. The compiler . converts the type of values to make sense of the operation rather than raising errors..I hope that after reading this article, you can justify the statements regarding the type systems used in different languages. In this post, I explored these principles across Go, JavaScript & Python just to cover a variety of examples.",

        "So Go finally made its way around to compare it with python. I am a hardcore fan of python, but this time I will try to keep this comparison non-biased. I have tried to put every edge of their usages into this comparison. Also tried to expand every inch so a beginner can understand very well..Table of Contents.Python was introduced back in 1991 in order to solve the data science-related tasks. With each passing day, this language has grown so faster while changes have taken place. With all this stuff happening with python made it capable of becoming the top language for executing in web servers, not to mention, the two popular frameworks . did well for python to achieve this goal..In 2021, Python has earned a decent place, majority of developers utilise this language in their projects, that is to state there, Python has become the universal language, which speaks to that it can handle almost every programming-related task..This great language is also beginner-friendly; its robust features are easy to learn even if someone is very new into the programming field. The best thing about Python is that it has some Distros, Anaconda is one of them that is more handling data science tasks. You can read here about .Drawbacks are also a part, in the case of python, although it is a wide range of applications, that’s what makes python vulnerable at some of its working areas. On top of them, it is not the fastest programming language, does not uphold memory usages, is not suitable for front-side, and the working areas in mobile are not so strong..Go is a statically typed compiled language, originated from the C family, as its syntaxes are closer to C. Having said that, Go short for (Golang) is designed to overcome some complexity that exists around, mainly the memory leaks, and speed performance. Go upholds them better..Until now java is the only considered the fastest language, after Go, that play head-to-head with Java in speed performance is so palpable..Similar to Python, Go also has assortments of use cases, on top of that are data science projects. As using Go, the data scraping process turned out far easier and speedy..Out of the context if you want to learn about languages for data science, . will be suitable with your taste..Python has a lot of IDEs that assist a developer catching up errors, and further assistance required in writing a program such as auto-completion is also possible. Anyways, sometimes the problem is not related to a mistake, by means that the code or function has to test by executing up in a server, to check if this is actually perfect or not. It is something python is not good with, as python code requires it to execute at once, not in parts..Go does not have such IDEs that can hunt down real-time errors and let you provide a helping hand to write your program. The developers are working to fill this vulnerability. For now, If you know how to write a perfect code only then Go is for you. However, being a compiled type language reduces much of the problem with catching errors while programming..Python has so many libraries, being an old programming language, it makes sense that a large amount of equipment is out there to back Python up. Tools such as Panda, TensorFlow take much of the stress when it comes to utilising Python in machine learning. Not to forget about Django, flask both are doing well when utilising python into web servers. A list of . is covered here,.Go does not have as many tools and libraries as python, that’s what limits it to be on the top programming language. Unlike Python, Go does not have libraries for different working areas. If you do a little bit search, you can see most of the Go libraries are for Data-organization tasks even though it is known as a general language..Python has vast community support, from. to ., you will get your problem resolved in no time. Moreover, a large number of online training classes are teaching Python. The website like.type of website offers a to z Python courses..Go being a younger language lacks community support. It is hard to find a solution related to Go, the online forums will be of no use, as hardly a few developers have mastered Go. Unlike python, you will face a tough time finding a working solution for your Go code, as you might be the one who will ask a certain question and get answered. This is how a community grows online..Python is the most beginner-friendly language all over the world. There is no doubt. Its syntaxes are closer to English that increase its readability. Why should a beginner choose python, because it has so many working applications, if you are not happy with playing with your web server, you don’t need to? You can move on; you’ll quickly find something interesting while programming with python, even you can build some basic mobile and desktop games with python code..Go has easy to ready syntaxes, and a small learning curve, yet might not be the right choice for a beginner to get hands-on with it first. The top reason for that is a beginner might feel some kind of limits while applying the Go code, however, if it is for learning data science, machine learning, Network programming, or something IT-related projects. Then, this makes no difference between python and Go. Choose whatever you like. .Some developers held benchmarks between Go and Python for sorting out the debate which one is performing better. And at what conditions?.We have gathered some data from several benchmarks. Perhaps after analysing the score, you will get to a point; moreover, these below-mentioned benchmarks will bring into light their performances..It is a performance test of getting a number, a list of 100000 was input similarly in Go and Python, only to see which one prompt-up the result faster, the number to search was 700..Here is the result of this performance test..The result is shocking, isn’t it? Go get the job done faster, actually too quicker than python. It made developers figure out which thing can impact so badly on python’s performance. And many of them ended up on a collision that, python has too many features, even it works as a scripting language that may lead python to generate such an inadequate response..After analysing the result, the developers held one more test even to verify the speed of Python and Go. But, this time the object was not integers, they were English alphabets. And the task was to count the alphabets from a text “lorem ipsum” file..The difference in their speed is evident. You can see like before Go proved to be forty times faster than python even when the object was changed. Yet there was one last object left, that was HTTP request handling, so let’s loot over the results that had gotten from there..To help this test, developers made an HTTPS server as the back end, and wote script something like when a request hits the server, both Python and Go ( programmes created by them) will start making a request simultaneously and serve a response into some words like “Hello world”..Again, the result is here;.Again as usually, Go handled the HTTPS request faster than Python..There is no much surprise in this catalogue of speed performance, for a reason the Go’s leading aim is to be a faster-compiling language, what is more up is that there are rumours about Go that it performs faster than Java which is currently the quickest programming language (in some overlapping working areas). However, Python, on the other hand, does not seem to make any impact if there is a language which is leaving behind python in terms of speed. As python still has the upper hand on Go, except just speed performance, countless features are out there that you can get only in Python, not in Go..Python so far comes with a standard choice for machine learning, tons of libraries and tools, especially for ML projects, are out there. With easy to understand, readable syntaxes, and ease in coding. Not to forget about Go’s overlapping features too that are almost similar, however, Go being a new language, does not have a wide range of libraries and tools for Machine learning..Both offer almost the same features in terms of readability and are easy to learn for beginners. How to decide which one will be more suitable for you then?.Generally speaking, a big part of machine learning is associated with servers; sometimes, we have to gather data from servers to execute them in machines. This is where Python seems to lack, mainly speed-performance, and credibility. On the other hand, Go takes advantage here as it comes up with some tools that come in handy while playing with servers..It is not something that python can’t do, but figuring out the best tools for that purpose, memory shortage issues are for sure some fundamental obstacles one has to first deal with..If your first target is to speed up the process on your Backend, choosing Go will be a wiser choice..Go supports concurrency which is the prime reason why Go can handle multiple requests at once, whereas Python does come up with such a feature..If we take this situation generally, assuming that backend speed is not the primary concern, in that case, python may have the upper hand in terms of some robust features, such that building REST API is one of them.",

        "A . is a great pet, but it is very concerning if they stop eating. You ask yourself, “how long can they go on for before they stave, and will they start eating again soon?”. Now we will discuss the asnwers to the question, how long can a ball python go without eating..You have come to the right place to answer these questions since we have figured out how long they can go without food and other interesting snippets about this gorgeous creature. .Contents.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a\nweb browser that\n.A pet ball python is often an easy snake to look after. This is why it is a favorite among first-time snake owners. However, there are a few things that can go wrong. And a major one is when your pet stops eating. There could be a few reasons for this. .Ball pythons need some heat so that they can swallow and digest their food. If it is too cold in their tank, they cannot eat even if they want to. Therefore, you should check the temperature, warm up their tank with a heating lamp, or move it into a sunny spot. .Your . while it is removing their old skin (shedding). You would know when a snake is about to shed due to their eyes looking milky and their skin looking dry and rough. Once their old skin is off, they will want to start eating again. .Ball pythons are like humans. Not every python is going to eat everything. There is a chance that your snake just does not like the smell, look, size, and how it was prepared. If it was frozen, if it was pre-killed, if it is alive, etc.  .This would require some experimentation to figure out what they want and to stick to it..Often when animals get sick, they do not eat. This could be the case with your ball python. They could have gotten ill and should be taken to the vet for a checkup..However, there is a chance that they could have gotten intestinal parasites.  .This can make them feel sick and lose weight. The way you can check is to take a sample of their droppings to the vet, so they can test it for worms and other parasites. However, if they do not move, take them to the vet as is. .Stress is a killer, not only for humans but also for reptiles and the rest of the animal kingdom..Your pet ball python could be stressed due to moving to a new place, having new roommates or you handle them too often. Hopefully, with time they will be fine..Ball pythons are fantasizing creatures about how their bodies can handle food or the lack of it. Healthy ...When we say without food, that means no snacks or anything. .A baby ball python goes from the age of zero to about four months old. However, they cannot survive without food for long. This is because they are still developing and growing. ..  .They go from the age of 4 months to about a year. You should pay attention to how often they want to be fed. Not as much as babies but maybe more than adults. Therefore, ..  .Adult ball pythons are from the ages of one to 30 years old. They reach their full size by three years of age. In this phrase, they are fed about once every ten to 14 days. As mentioned, they can go for half a year with no food.  .Their bodies adjust to the lack of food by using the energy they have stored away and conserving their energy. They achieve this by lowering their metabolism rate. Food gives energy and since ball pythons can store energy for emergencies they can live without food for a long time. .Snakes (not only ball pythons) can lower their metabolism by about 70 percent. However, regarding ball pythons, in particular, they naturally do not use that much energy regardless of the season and location. This could be because ball pythons do not use much protein unless they are eating. .Therefore, they can save and regulate their energy. Plus, adult ball pythons can go without water for about 12 days with no negative repercussions.  .They could have adopted this system of survival due to the winter months when their food (rats, other small mammals, lizards, amphibians, birds, and other snakes) is almost impossible to come by.  .Either everything leaves in winter (like birds), hibernates, or goes into finding to gather heat. Winter is a hard season to find food, so ball pythons have adapted by lowering their metabolism and using their reversed energy.  .This happens in the wild, pet ball pythons do not have to hold onto energy since their food is provided by you. If they stop eating it probably means that something serious is up. They are not prepping for their survival. .The thing with all . is that they do not have teeth in the traditional sense of the word. Some can have .. The venom can have digestive enzymes that break down the food before they swallow it.  .However, ball pythons are not venomous, so they use a slightly different system to eat their food. All snakes can be seen as being a long digestive tunnel. When they are active, their digestive system is not and visa-a-versa. .Snakes’ jaws are designed to gulp down food in a somewhat continuous motion, even though it takes a long time until they finish eating. Their bottom jaw has two parts to it to help move the food throughout the entire digestive system that starts at the mouth.  .They coat the prey in their saliva with digestive enzymes, regardless of whether the snake is venomous or not. Snakes’ esophagus (the tube that makes the food travel to the required areas) has a lot of muscles, and it is very long. .This is how the food can travel from the mouth of the snake to the stomach. The ribs also help to move the eaten prey along. The final stop is the stomach, where the meal is completely broken down even further. .The snake will digest everything except for hair and claws. However, snakes have to measure how much of the prey they can eat. While they can eat an entire body, this will not be good if it is too big for them. In that case, they would throw it up. .This is because the food, especially if it is too big, can rot inside its bodies while digesting it. Rotting food inside their bodies can lead to a lot of harm, even death. This is called Distension (a ballooning effect)..Exciting facts when it comes to snakes is that they can eat up to 25 percent of their weight. But pythons can eat more than 25 percent of their weight and eat up to about 65 percent.  .However, the bigger the meal, the more time to digest, and the more likely it is to rot. Rotting food can result in the snake throwing it back up. But other factors can also influence whether a snake vomits or not.  .If they are stressed, or the temperature is too low for them to finish digesting their food. There could also be other types of health problems, causing them to vomit..Source: .Another thing when it comes to snakes is that they are like humans when it comes to food. Not only do they like a variety, but certain portions as well.  .Some snakes can eat small amounts of prey throughout the day, while others only want to devour one huge meal now and then. Like people, some can eat small snacks while others have a huge meal, and both are fine.  .However, snakes that eat less often (like the ones that prefer one huge meal) livers, heart, and intestine can express growth when they have a meal. Plus, they can take in about 60 times more oxygen. .Being a snake seems to take a lot of hard work to the outside eye. But they make it look easy since it is for them. They are cold-blooded. They get their heat from the sun (or lamps if they are pets) since their bodies cannot create heat. .Even though they are cold-blooded, their body’s temperature can match the area that they live in. This means that if the temperature drops (like in winter), they could die from the cold. Therefore, they find a warm cave and sleep the winter away.  .If a bear were to act like a snake, they would most likely starve, or their skin would be ripped off due to sliding around on a coarse surface. Snake’s bodies are a wonderland of how it works well with what others would view as disadvantages like the lack of arms.  .There is shedding, but that is due to their bodies growing, not to them sliding around. When they shed their skin, they also get rid of the parasites on them. This does sound convenient, instead of picking them off one by one, and their skin after shedding is new. .Regarding hunting, many snakes (like the ball pythons) are nocturnal. This means that they hunt at night when the visibility is low. It gives them a chance to quickly and quietly sneak up to their prey.  .Since it is dark, it is hard for snakes to be spotted, giving them enough time to prepare for a well-executed lunge. They would grab their prey with their quick movements (like a slide of hand). Snakes can see in the dark due to several factors such as: .This makes them masters at hunting at night. Plus, they are low to the ground, so they can hide in the long grass. If their prey hears something, they could easily think it was the wind. .A snake’s mouth is an escapable death tube. They have tiny “teeth” that grip their prey into place. These “teeth” actually point into their mouths instead of down like ordinary teeth tend to do. This helps them to move their food down their body to the stomach. .You know what they say about desperate times? Well, if need be, then you can force them to eat. However, before you start on this crazy adventure, check-in with your vet or a snake expert if you should. .Force-feeding is one of the ways that you can get your pet snake to start eating again. However, you should never use this on a dehydrated snake. To tell if they are, their skin would look like it has wrinkles and clusters.  .If they are dehydrated, then you should soak them in the water a few times a day. You can also make a humidity box with a hole them to climb in and out of. A bowl of water would not hurt either. If they look the same, there may be something more serious, and off to the vet, you go. .If your snake looks fine then give force-feeding a shot. You can feed them a mouse’s head with tweezers. Or you can use a syringe with a portion of mashed up cat food. This might answer the question how long can a ball python go without eating..First, you would cut off the head of a mouse and pick it up using tweezers. Then take your snake by holding them at the back of their head and gently pressing the mouse’s head against their lips until they open up. If they go not swallow, use a thin steel stick to push it down.  .From here, you would push the head down and pass the neck of the ball python. Once it has passed there, you gently massage their body until the food reaches their stomach. It is a third of the way down. Then leave them alone in a warm area, so they can digest. .Take a small syringe (about 3 to 5 ml) and fill it with either liquefied cat food or a beaten egg mixed with vitamin and .. Once ready, take your ball python by the back of their jaw and gently press on both sides to open and keep the mouth open. You can wet their lips with water.  .Insert the syringe until it passes their neck. Empty the contents and then remove the syringe to close their mouth and keep it for a few seconds if they want to vomit. Then place them in a warm spot and leave them.  .A pet snake is different from that of a snake in the wild. Pet snakes cannot go out and hunt for their food, and they rely on you to find them. The number of times you should feed your adult ball python is usually once every ten to two weeks..Baby ball pythons should be fed more often since they are still growing. Therefore, a meal every five, or six, or seven days is the aim. The number of days will depend on your baby snake, so keep an eye on them and figure out their pattern.  .Pet ball pythons food of choice is anything that has a lot of protein in it. They are carnivores and use the protein to give themselves the energy to eat their meals and digest it. Their food can be hamsters, gerbils, but their favorite (and the easiest to get) are mice or rats.  .Some ball pythons could munch down pre-killed mice, others could handle frozen ones. It is best to check with a specialist regarding your scaly friend since every ball python is different. Hence, the variety of days you can feed a baby one. .However, you can not change their diet. You can change the number of times you feed them. More when they are a baby and less as an adult. But you cannot change what you feed them. They need a high level of protein, so adding greens will not be noticed by them. .Plus, some ball pythons are just picky eaters that will not eat unless it is to their standard.  .As a reminder: snakes need time to digest their food. Therefore, you should not pick them up and start playing with them within two days of feeding them. This may freak them out, causing them to throw up..Vomiting is not good, but what is worse is their stomach acid. It is very strong, and it can hurt you or the outside of their bodies. So just watch them as they digest for two days and then play with them a bit. .This concludes the question how long can a ball python go without eating. I hope I answered your question..Ball pythons can go for six months without eating. But pet ones should not have to. However, if you notice that they are unwell and have not gotten any better, it is best to take them to the vet as soon as possible.. . . ",

Now I’ve got more videos and the respective notes and details about what two language stacks I setup next; Python and Go..In regards to the Python stack, this one can often be somewhat confusing. Depending on the operating system I setup the stack a little differently..For MacOS I’ve written two posts about this previously, one titled “.” and one “.“. Those two posts cover most of the nuance to getting a base Python stack installed on MacOS and then using virtual environments to manage project specific versions per repository..For the Linux OS, usually a debian variant, the systems tend to have Python 3 installed by default. I then take the next step of installing pip3 and work from there.

One of the first reasons is that Python is required for installing and using numerous Python related CLIs, such as AWS’s CLI, among many others. It pays off to just have a good install at the system level (i.e. not particular just in a virutal environment, but executable at the terminal on system) to ensure it is available for any and all CLIs that would need it.

        "March 2021.Summary: I describe a simple interview problem (counting frequencies of unique words), solve it in various languages, and compare performance across them. For each language, I’ve included a simple, idiomatic solution as well as a more optimized approach via profiling.. . | . . . . . . . . . | .I’ve conducted many coding interviews over the past few years, and one of the questions I like to ask is this:.Write a program to count the frequencies of unique words from standard input, then print them out with their frequencies, ordered most frequent first. For example, given this input:.The program should print the following:.I think this is a good interview question because it’s somewhat harder to solve than ., but it doesn’t suffer from the “invert a binary tree on this whiteboard” issue. It’s the kind of thing a programmer might have to write a script for in real life, and it shows whether they understand file I/O, hash tables (maps), and how to use their language’s sort function. There’s a little bit of trickiness in the sorting part, because most hash tables aren’t ordered, and if they are, it’s by key or insertion order and not by value..After the candidate has a basic solution, you can push it in all sorts of different directions: what about capitalization? punctuation? how does it order two words with the same frequency? what’s the performance bottleneck likely to be? how does it fare in terms of big-O? what’s the memory usage? roughly how long would your program take to process a 1GB file? would your solution still work for 1TB? and so on. Or you can take it in a “software engineering” direction and talk about error handling, testability, turning it into a hardened command line utility, etc..A basic solution reads the file line-by-line, converts to lowercase, splits each line into words, and counts the frequencies in a hash table. When that’s done, it converts the hash table to a list of word-count pairs, sorts by count (largest first), and prints them out..In Python, one obvious solution using a plain . might look like this (imports elided):.If the candidate was a Pythonista, they might use . or even . – see below for code using the latter. In that case I’d ask them how it worked under the hood, or how they might solve it with a plain dictionary..Incidentally, this problem . for a wizard duel between two computer scientists several decades ago. In 1986, Jon Bentley asked Donald Knuth to show off “literate programming” with a solution to this problem, and he came up with an exquisite, .. Then Doug McIlroy (the inventor of Unix pipelines) replied with a one-liner . using ., ., and ...In any case, I’ve been playing with this problem for a while now, and I wanted to see what the program would look like in various languages, and how fast they would run, both with a simple idiomatic solution and with a more optimized version. I’m including large snippets of code in the article, but full source for each version is in my . repository. Or you can cheat and jump straight to the ...Each program must read from standard input and print the frequencies of unique, space-separated words, in order from most frequent to least frequent. To keep our solutions simple and consistent, here are the (self-imposed) constraints I’m working against:.Our . will be the text of the King James Bible, concatenated ten times. I sourced this ., replaced smart quotes with the ASCII quote character, and used . to multiply it by ten to get the 43MB reference input file..So let’s get coding! The solutions below are in the order I solved them..An idiomatic Python version would probably use .. Python’s . library is really nice – thanks Raymond Hettinger! It’s about as simple as you can get:.This is Unicode-aware and is probably what I’d write in “real life”. It’s actually quite efficient, because all the low-level stuff is really done in C: reading the file, converting to lowercase and splitting on whitespace, updating the counter, and the sorting that . does..But let’s try to optimize! Python comes with a . called .. It’s easy to use – simply run your program using .. I’ve commented out the final . call to avoid the profiling output mixing with the program’s output – it’s fairly negligible anyway. Here’s the output (. sorts by total time in each function):.We can see a number of things here:.The main thing we need to do is reduce the number of times around the main Python loop, and hence reduce the number of calls to all those functions. So let’s read it in 64KB chunks:.Instead of our main loop processing 42 characters at a time (the average line length), we’re processing 65,536 at a time (less the partial line at the end). We’re still reading and processing the same number of bytes, but we’re now doing most of it in C rather than in the Python loop. Many of the optimized solutions use this basic approach – process things in bigger chunks..The profiling output looks much better now. The . and . functions are still taking most of the time, but they’re only being called 662 times instead 998170 (on roughly 64KB at a time rather than 42 bytes):.I also found that with the Python solution, reading and processing . vs . doesn’t make a noticeable difference (the . is relatively far down the list). In addition, any buffer size above about 2KB is not much slower than 64KB – I’ve noticed many systems have a default buffer size of 4KB, which seems very reasonable in light of that..I tried various other ways to improve performance, but this was about the best I could manage with standard Python. (I tried running it using the . optimizing compiler, but it’s significantly slower for some reason.) Trying to optimize at the byte level just makes no sense in Python (or leads to a 10-100x slowdown) – any per-character processing has to be done in C. Let me know if you find a better approach..A simple, idiomatic Go version would probably use . with . as the split function. Go doesn’t have anything like Python’s ., but it’s easy to use a . for counting, and a slice of word-count pairs for the sort operation:.The simple Go version is significantly faster than the simple Python version, but only a little bit faster than the optimized Python version (and almost double the number of lines of code – there’s definitely more boilerplate and low-level concerns)..To use Go’s profiler, you have to add a few lines of code to the start of your program (in addition to .):.Once you’ve run the program, you can view the CPU profile using this command (click to view the image full size):.The results are interesting, though not unexpected – the operations in the per-word hot loop take all the time. A good chunk of the time is spent in the scanner, and another chunk is spent allocating strings to insert into the map, so let’s try to optimize both of those parts..To improve scanning, we’ll do the word scanning and convert to ACIII lowercase as we go. To reduce the allocations, we’ll use a . instead of . so we only have to allocate once per unique word, instead of for every increment (Martin Möhrmann gave me this tip on the Gophers Slack #performance channel)..Note that it took me a few iterations and profiling passes to get to this result. One in-between step was to still use . but with a custom split function, .. However, it’s a bit faster, and not any harder, to avoid . altogether. Another thing I tried was a ., but I decided that was out of scope for the Go version, and it’s not much faster than the . in any case..My . had a subtle bug which resulted in incorrect output . of the time: if . did a partial read (which happens but is not common) and the bytes read didn’t include a linefeed character, the code would split the last word in the middle and count it as two words. This just goes to show how easy it is to break things when optimizing (and how subtle the semantics of Go’s . are)..In fact, in the original version of this article I’d prophesied that this might happen:.It’s trickier code, and there is lots of potential for off-by-one errors (I’d be surprised if there isn’t some bug already)..In any case, it’s fixed now. Thanks to Miguel Angel for . and simplifying the code..The profiling results are now very flat – almost everything’s in the main loop or the map access:.It was a fun exercise, and Go gives you a fair bit of low-level control (and you could go quite a lot further – memory mapped I/O, a custom hash table, etc). However, programmer time is valuable, so it’s always a trade-off. In practice I’d probably stick with a . with ., ., and the . trick..C++ has come a long way since I last used it seriously: lots of goodies in C++11, and then more in C++14, 17, and 20. Features, features everywhere! It’s definitely a lot terser than old-school C++, though the error messages are still a mess. Here’s the simple version I came up with (with some . to make it a bit more idiomatic):.When optimizing this, the first thing to do is compile with optimizations enabled (.). I kind of like the fact that with Go you don’t have to worry about this – optimizations are always on..I noticed that I/O was comparatively slow. It turns out there is a magic incantation you can recite at the start of your program to disable synchronizing with the C stdio functions after each I/O operation. This line makes it run almost twice as fast:.GCC can generate a profiling report for use with .. Here’s what a few lines of it looks like – I kid you not:.Ah, C++ templates. Call me old-school, but I do prefer the names . and . over ...I really didn’t feel like deciphering this output, so I kind of gave up and spent my energy on the optimized C version. There’s obviously a lot more pushing you could do with C++. However, I suspect it would end up getting more and more low-level and more C-like (at least with my limited knowledge of modern C++), so if you want to see more of that, go to the C variants below..I used the Valgrind profiler (Callgrind) in the C version – see the section below for notes on that. Andrew Gallant pointed out that I could try the Linux . tool (specifically . and .) – it does look better than ...Update: . and . and others optimized the C++ version. Thanks!.C is a beautiful beast that will never die: fast, unsafe, and simple (for some value of “simple”). I still like it, because (unlike C++) I can understand it, and I can go as low-level as I want. It’s also ubiquitous (the Linux kernel, Redis, PostgreSQL, SQLite, many many libraries … the list is endless), and it’s not going away anytime soon. So let’s try a C version..Unfortunately, C doesn’t have a hash table data structure in its standard library. However, there is libc, which has the . hash table functions, so we’ll make a small exception and use those libc-but-not-stdlib functions. In the optimized version we’ll roll our own hash table..One minor annoyance with . is you have to specify the maximum table size up-front. I know the number of unique words is about 30,000, so we’ll make it 60,000 for now..There’s a fair bit of boilerplate (mostly for memory allocation and error checking), but as far as C goes, I don’t think it’s too bad. The tricky stuff is mostly hidden – tokenization behind ., and hash table operations behind .. It’s also relatively fast out of the box, and very small (a 17KB executable on Linux)..To profile, I tried using ., but it didn’t show anything useful (maybe it’s not sampling often enough?), so I investigated using the . profiler, .. This was the first time I’ve used it, but it seems like an amazing and powerful tool..After building with ., I ran this command to generate the profile:.Not surprisingly, it shows that . is the major culprit, followed by .. So here’s where we’ll go a bit crazy with optimization. I want to focus on three things:.At around 150 lines (including blanks and comments), it’s definitely the biggest program yet, but not too bad! As you can see, rolling your own hash table with linear probing is not a lot of code. It’s not great to have a fixed size table, but adding dynamic resizing is just busy-work, and doesn’t slow down the running time significantly, so I’ve left that as an exercise for the reader..It’s still only a 17KB executable (that’s what I love about C). And, unsurprisingly, this is the fastest version – a little bit faster than the optimized Go version, because we’ve rolled our own custom hash table, and we’re processing fewer bytes..As shown in the ., this version is only about 15% slower than . on the same input (with . to allow ASCII-only whitespace handling). And all the . utility has to do is tokenize words, not count unique words, so it doesn’t need a hash table..This program is significantly slower than the incredible GNU ., of course. There’s a semi-famous mailing list message from 2010 by Mike Haertel, original author of GNU grep, on .. It’s fascinating reading – however, as Andrew Gallant (author of .) pointed out to me, that post is somewhat out of date. Mike’s general advice is good, but these days GNU grep is fast not so much due to skipping bytes with the Boyer-Moore algorithm, but because it uses a fast, vectorized implementation of . in glibc..I’m sure there’s further you could go with the C version: investigate memory-mapped I/O, avoid processing byte-at-a-time, use a fancier data structure for counting, etc. But this is quite enough for now!.AWK is actually a great tool for this job: reading lines and parsing into space-separated words are what it eats for breakfast. One thing AWK can’t do (without resorting to Gawk-specific features) is the sorting, so I’m using the AWK pipe operator to send the output through .. Here’s the beautifully simple code:.I don’t know of an easy way to profile this at a low level (Gawk does have a ., but it just shows how many times each line was executed). I also don’t know how to read the input in chunks using AWK or Gawk..One small tweak I made for the optimized version was to call . once per line instead of for every word. The main loop becomes:.We can run this using ., which puts Gawk into “bytes” mode so it uses ASCII instead of UTF-8. This “optimized” version using . is about 1.6x as fast as the simple version using straight ...Another “optimization” is to run it using ., a faster AWK interpreter than .. In this case it’s about 1.7 times as fast as .. I’m using . in the benchmarks for the optimized version..Interestingly, the Gawk manual has a . on this word-frequency problem, with an example of how to strip out punctuation using AWK’s . function..If you’re interested in learning more about AWK, I’ve written an article about ., my AWK interpreter written in Go (it’s normally about as fast as Gawk), and also an article for LWN called ., which surveys the “AWK landscape” and digs into the new features in Gawk 5.1.. was the first programming language I learned (it’s an amazing and mind-expanding language), so I decided to try a Forth version using .. I haven’t written anything in the language for years, but here goes (though I’m not sure it’s valid to call this .!):.It’s not for nothing that Forth has a reputation for being write-only. I used to love the idea of no local variables, but in practice it just means a lot of .. In addition, even Gforth (which has a lot more than ANS standard Forth) doesn’t have fairly basic tools like . or ., so we have to roll those ourselves (the in-place merge sort was .)..Thankfully hash tables are present via .. This is really intended for defining new Forth words, but with Gforth’s . extension it works pretty well for hash tables. And . and . work well for the whitespace parsing (thanks . folks for your help)..For optimizing, it turns out you can run . instead of . to magically speed things up, so that’s my first optimization (though in the benchmarks, I use . for both versions). It looks like . avoids call overhead but doesn’t produce good stack traces on error..I’m far from proficient in Forth these days, and I didn’t really know where to start with profiling in Gforth (though it . they have some kind of support for it)..Anton Ertl was very helpful on my comp.lang.forth post, and spent some time trying to optimize this – read the . for more information. I’ve hacked together a combination of my program and his optimizations below (modified to read in chunks of 64KB):.I might still consider using Forth for fun or on tiny embedded systems, but I don’t think it has the ergonomics or the libraries to write programs for general use. For a much richer, more modern take on a Forth-like language, check out ...I’m a heavy user of Andrew Gallant’s excellent . code search tool, and I knew he was pretty big into Rust (and optimization), so before publishing this article I asked him if he’d be willing to do a Rust version..He more than delivered! He wrote simple and optimized versions, which are similar to the Go variants (and very close in speed). But then he wrote three additional versions (some of which use external dependencies):.His simple version doesn’t use any external dependencies, and is similar to the simple Go and C++ versions (his comments included).I definitely like what I’ve seen and heard about Rust, and I’d learn it over modern C++ any day, though I understand it’s got a fairly steep learning curve … and quite a few . sigils..For the optimized version, I’ll include his comments here (and copy the code from . on):.This version is an approximate port of the optimized Go program. Its buffer\nhandling is slightly simpler: we don’t bother with dealing with the last\nnewline character. (This may appear to save work, but it only saves work\nonce per 64KB buffer, so is likely negligible. It’s just simpler IMO.).There’s nothing particularly interesting here other than swapping out std’s\ndefault hashing algorithm for one that isn’t cryptographically secure..std uses a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm by default, which is\na bit slower. In this particular program, fxhash and fnv seem to perform\nsimilarly, with fxhash being a touch faster in my ad hoc benchmarks. If\nwe wanted to really enforce the “no external crate” rule, we could just\nhand-roll an fnv hash impl ourselves very easily..Thanks, Andrew!.Let’s try a version with only basic Unix command line tools – this is essentially .:.It’s quite slow, in part because it has to sort the entire file at once rather than using a hash table for counting (reading the entire file into memory actually goes against the constraints I’ve imposed). However, I was surprised at how much it speeds up if you set the locale of the first . to C (ASCII-only) – that speeds it up by a factor of 5, which is faster than the algorithmically-better approaches in other languages!.And we can get a bit more performance out of it by using . to give it a larger buffer (while we’re breaking constraints, we might as well break them properly). Interestingly, sort’s . option doesn’t help at this scale. So the optimized version is as follows:.This is fine for relatively small files. If I wanted to process huge files and not read the entire thing into memory to sort, I’d probably reach for the AWK or Python versions..The output is not quite the same as the others, because the format is “space-prefixed-count word” rather than “word count”, like so:.We could fix that with something like ., but then we’re using AWK anyway, and we might as well use the more efficient . above..Many readers contributed to the . repository to add other popular languages – thank you! (Note that I’m no longer taking new contributions.).Here’s the list:.Below are the performance numbers of running these programs on my laptop (64-bit Linux with an SSD using these .). I’m running each test five times and taking the minimum time as the result (see .). Each run is basically equivalent to the following command:.The times are in seconds, so lower is better, and the list is ordered by the execution time of the simple version, fastest first. (Note that . and . don’t actually solve the word counting problem, they’re just here for comparison.).What can we learn from all this? Here are a few thoughts:.This was definitely a fun exercise! I learned a good amount about optimization hot-spots, using the Valgrind profiler, and I wrote some Forth code for the first time in years..Let me know your thoughts or feedback, or send ideas for improvements (see the discussions on ., ., and .).",

        "Both Go and Python are incredibly relevant today. Both are widely used programming languages in the developer's community. Go is a much newer language compared to Python, released by Google in 2009. Though Python has witnessed immense popularity in web development, Golang is also gaining higher popularity and giving tough competition to Python. So, in the spirit of helping you choose which programming language is better, we've decided to come up with this write-up..In this . blog, we'll compare the two programming languages based on various parameters that help you decide which one is best suited for you..But, before getting into comparing, let's have a quick introduction to both these languages..Go is also commonly known as .. Google developed this open-source programming language. Its development began in 2007 and was introduced into the market in 2009. Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson have designed this programming language based on C's syntax. This language supports concurrent programming, memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and many more. .Go is developed for ease of programming and writing code, and interpreted with the efficiency and safety of statically typed compiled language. It's not only easy to work with Go, but many powerful features make Go popular..That's enough about Go now. Let's talk a little bit about Python.. is one of the top programming languages today, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. Inbuilt data structures with dynamic typing and binding make it very appealing for fast application development and also known as a scripting language to connect components. Most importantly, Python's simple syntax rules make it easier for you to keep the code base readable and easily maintainable..As it requires significantly few code lines, the majority of web applications and platforms rely on Python, including Youtube, Google search engine, and more..Now that you got a brief introduction to both these programming languages. Next, let's move forward and discuss the parameters based on making the differences between Python and Go..Firstly, we'll compare the parameters of the paradigm of the languages..Go paradigms are Procedural, functional, and concurrent language. In contrast, Python paradigms are object-oriented, imperative, functional, and reflective language. Go is a statically typed language which offers a smooth debugging process, and Python is dynamically-typed, that means checks the bugs only at run time..When we look at the performance of Go and Python, Go is extremely fast, similar to Java and C++, which are the fast programming languages right now. Go language performance is 40 times faster than Python. Based on that, we'll look into some comparing terms of mathematical functions using both languages, namely, Mandelbrot, N-body, and Binary Tree..These are complex real-time problems that take lots of computation to perform. Now we'll test both languages' performance by running code on it and checking which one is fair..That clearly shows Go language triumphs over Python in terms of performance measures. Now let's move forward to the next parameter of comparison, i.e., readability..Code readability is one of the crucial things to consider while working with a team on a project. Python has fantastic readability, but you can represent something probably in 10 different ways in Python, which usually leads to confusion when code is a significant or large number of people working on the code..On the other hand, if you look at Go, it comes with strict programming rules and doesn't import unnecessary libraries. This means Go has a better understanding of code when a large number of people are working on it..When talking about the syntax, here Python wins as its syntax is similar to English sentences, which is easy to learn when talking about syntax. Golang syntax is considerably less friendly to beginners..The above example takes some calculations for both languages. As you can see in Python, developing code is simple, and in Go, it's not very easy. By comparing, we can say that Python syntax is easier to learn than the Go language. .Nowadays, building scalable applications is an art of work. If applications are not scalable, then it causes loss to the business. Keeping this in Mind, Google developed the Go language to help developers solve complex problems at the scale of Google. Golang has inbuilt support for concurrent process channelling. On the other hand, Python has a tough time with concurrency and can only implement parallelism through threads..The terms concurrency and parallelism are often related to multithreaded programs. Concurrency means an application is making progress on more than one task at the same time..Whereas parallelism means splitting application tasks into smaller subtasks and that can be processed in parallel, for instance, on multiple CPUs simultaneously. .So, the language that inherently supports concurrency is perfect for big and large scale applications, and Golang takes the cake home..Now, let's move to the next parameter of comparison, i.e., Libraries..Having excellent support for libraries is crucial for programming. Here Python wins over Go for having a tremendous amount of libraries.Packages like Numpy help you with array handling, and complex matrix functions, OpenCV for image processing, . and Scikit Learn for deep learning, Matplotlib for visualization, Pandas for data analysis, and the list goes on. And this is what Python is known for..And this doesn't mean Go falls short here. The number might not be as of Python, but the usage of fields covered is the same. They have insane libraries for data handling, web development, encryption, concurrent programming, and more..Now, let's compare how Go and Python execute the code..Python is a dynamically typed language, and Go is a statically typed language. In a statically typed language, the variable values are declared explicitly for the compilers, so the advantage is that the compiler performs all types of checks, and many trivial bugs are caught at an early stage. .In a dynamically typed language, type-interference is implemented by the interpreter, and hence some bugs may remain. This means Pythons limits the programmer while building heavy programming. On the other hand, Go can handle any programming (big or small) with finesse..So now, let's have a glance at our next parameter that is storage..Python offers no memory management and manages the memory automatically as soon as a variable is allotted. Python Virtual Manages the whole set of memory. On the other hand, Go provides you with excellent memory management, which also comes in handy while running complex problems that we have seen above while comparing both the languages' performance. .Now, let's get to the final part of the comparison,i.e., Applications..Now, there's not going to be a clear winner in this comparison as every language is made for some purpose, so we cannot say any particular language as a winner. Python is more suitable for web development, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and deep learning because of the great libraries..Go is more inclined towards system programming as it supports concurrency. Also, found a generous amount of use and acceptance in the fields of cloud computing and cluster computing. Powerful inbuilt libraries allow us to build web servers in a matter of seconds. .It's challenging to conclude Go vs. Python discussion because comparing a mature language with a relatively young one doesn't seem fair. Python has strong community support and is a leading language in machine learning, web development, and data analysis. At the same time, Go has been here only for a decade and has not built a strong community yet. But one clear advantage of Go is its speed, and it occupies the place of 13th most popular languages in 2020. Meanwhile, Python occupies third place on the list but took 25 years to get there. Python was not famous for the first ten years. So, the world is wide open for Golang as well..So guys, now tell us which one is better according to you Python or Go and why?

        "by ., 10 Mar 2016.As a programmer you are expected to learn new technologies regularly.\nEven when the documentation is excellent, there will typically be underlying assumptions that go unstated because they are so obvious to the writer.\nAnd documentation is not always good..But if you have relevant technical depth you will be able to recognize the commonalities and differences within a category of technologies, e.g. programming languages or databases.\nThis means a new programming language will be easier to learn: you will recognize familiar features, different trade-offs, and some of the motivations of design choices.\nYou will also be better able to judge the usefulness of the new technology.\nOne way to improve your technical depth is to compare a single task across multiple technologies..Let’s consider a particular task: cleaning up a resource.\nIf your code wants to write to a file you will open the file, write to it, and eventually close it.\nForgetting to close the file might mean writes don’t get written to disk until much later than you expected, or that certain resources get leaked.\nOn Unix systems if you don’t close file descriptors your process will eventually run out and not be able to open any new files..Most programming languages allow returning from a function at multiple points, so cleanup ends up being repetitive.\nThis makes it easier for you to forget to cleanup a resource you acquired or created within the function..Many languages allow leaving a function in more than one way, e.g. with both returns and exceptions.\nOnce you have exceptions in your language . part of your code might result in leaving the function due to a thrown exception, making resource cleanup even harder to get right:.As a result most languages provide an idiom or feature for automatically cleaning up resources, regardless of how or when you return from a function.\nLet’s compare the idioms for C++, Go and Python and see what we can learn..Python functions can return via .ed result, or via a raised exception.\nOne way to cleanup a resource is via . clause based on the exception handling syntax of .:.The code in the . block will always be called regardless of whether the . block returned, raised an exception, or execution continues.\n(Python also has a more modern . idiom that I’m going to ignore for brevity’s sake.).Go lacks exceptions, so there is no exception syntax to build on.\nInstead, Go provides a . statement that schedules a cleanup function to be run when the main function returns..Python has a similar facility implemented as library code in the . class, where you can register cleanup functions for a test:.While . could be used, failed tests are indicated by raising an . exception.\nThis means any test that wants to cleanup multiple resources will be forced to have many nested . clauses, which is the likely motivation for having the . API..The C++ idiom is very different, relying on class destructors: we construct a . class whose destructor closes the file, and then allocate the . object on the stack when we use it.\nWhen the function returns the . instance on the stack is destroyed, and therefore its destructor is called and the underlying file is closed..Notice that this relies on deterministic deallocation of .: since it’s on the stack, it will . be deallocated when the function ends.\nThis mechanism cannot be used in Python or Go because they are garbage collected, and so there is no guarantee an object will be cleared from memory immediately.\nPython will close a file when it is garbage collected, but warns you that you should have closed it yourself:.What have we learned from all this?.You can now apply this knowledge to the next new programming language you learn..Comparing a specific task can help you gain technical depth in other areas as well.\nAnd if you’re learning a new technology comparing tasks with technologies you already know will help you learn the new technology that much faster.\nA good task is easy but not completely trivial: adding integers doesn’t differ much between programming languages, so comparing it won’t teach you anything interesting.\nFor databases you might compare “how would I allocate a unique id to a newly created record?” or “how can I safely increment a counter from multiple clients?”\nAnd ideally you should compare more than two technologies, since there’s almost always more than two solutions to any problem..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n      Helping you become a productive programmer and get work/life balance.© 2021 Hyphenated Enterprises LLC.
