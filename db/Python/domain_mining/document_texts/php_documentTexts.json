Almost any . needs a website and a mobile app - both of which connect to a server in the backend. Therefore, . are high in demand in the market and companies are willing to throw large sums of money to developers who can manage the backend well. Get the difference between Python and PHP through this post..Many programming languages that are being used for backend development are emerging in the market:.For new developers, it is always a matter of confusion - which backend framework to learn? With so many new . which offer so many features, libraries, and frameworks, how does one actually decide on which web framework to learn? In this blog post, we will try to compare 2 of the most popular backend programming languages - Python and PHP. We will try to cover various aspects and see which one of them wins..Before we do the comparison, let us first list the points of comparison which significantly will affect our choice of web framework:.Released in 1991 and developed by Guido van Rossum, Python is an interpreted high-level functional .. Python has its uses in web development, software development, and system scripting. It is favorite to many programmers. as well as data scientists as it offers many features like working on different platforms, run on interpreter system, it is easy to code as it's syntax is similar to the English language..Although Python has an ample number of uses, the majority of them includes creating web applications, connecting to database systems as it can read and modify files, handling big data, and perform complex mathematics. Python has always been an excellent choice to start learning to program because of the features it offers..Hypertext Pre-processor aka PHP is a widely used, open-sourced scripting language. PHP is capable of generating dynamic page content. It can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server. It can collect form data and also can send and receive from cookies. PHP is also database friendly and can add, delete, modify data in the database. It can also be used to control user access and to encrypt data..Now let us get to each of the above factors and see how Python and PHP compare with each other..Without any doubt, Python is much easier to learn. Python is a general-purpose programming language, and it can be picked up very quickly. In fact, Python is so simple to pick up that most programming courses for beginners now use Python programming language to teach fundamentals of programming. Python programs are much shorter and easy-to-write as compared to other programming languages and as a consequence, it has become a preferred choice for a lot of applications. The syntax is much simpler and the code is extremely readable as compared to the same code written in other programming languages..PHP, on the other hand, wasn’t meant to be a general-purpose language. It was designed specifically for web applications which are definitely more sophisticated than simple, stand-alone programs. As a result, it takes more time to . than it takes to .Time is taken to learn a programming language should be one of the most important factors in choosing which language to pick. For beginners, Python is much easier. PHP, on the other hand, can be a bit tough for novice programmers. PHP was designed to create simple personal pages but off late it has grown in complexity. The PHP developer community is trying hard to provide a lot of support for new programmers. However, as mentioned above, Python wins here by a significant margin owing to the inherent simplicity of the language. The syntaxes and the constructs in Python are amazingly simple to grasp..Python and PHP, both have excellent community support. PHP has been in the market for quite a while, particularly for developing web applications. As a result, there is a huge community of PHP developers that is ready to provide support..Python matches closely here with PHP. There are loads of Python developers in the market who are continuously developing Python applications. As a result, community support is outstanding. Python and PHP are both close here with none of them being a clear winner..Python became popular when Google started using it for some of the popular Google apps like YouTube. Many powerful startups like Instagram, Pinterest, and Reddit use Python-based web applications. Having said that, it must be noted that the world’s largest social network - Facebook has been written using PHP as the primary backend..Extensive documentation is available for both programming languages. There are innumerable websites, forums, discussion boards that provide excellent tutorials on how to develop applications using Python or PHP. Competition is stiff here and just like community support, there isn’t really a clear winner. Both languages are equally good in terms of documentation availability..Python and PHP are both completely free and open source. Both win here as well. In fact, both Python and PHP here win significantly over other paid web frameworks..Now, this is one point where Python significantly beats PHP. Python has exceptionally well-developed library support for almost all types of applications. PHP lags in this aspect wrt to Python, but . (PHP packages repository) is a strong backbone holding PHP. These days, for instance, a lot of startups and even large organizations are developing Machine Learning backed web applications. Python provides some excellent Machine Learning libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Theano, Scikit Learn, etc. These libraries are fast, easy-to-use and most importantly, they integrate brilliantly with the web framework. As a result, developing such type of applications using Python is far simpler as compared to almost any other programming language..PHP 5.x versions were quite slow, taking a lot of time in execution. However, the new release PHP 7.x is extremely fast, almost 3 times faster than a typical Python program. Speed often becomes an important factor in performance-critical applications. For instance, in a core banking system that gets a million hits on a daily basis, a delay of 3 times might create a significant impact on the overall system performance. Therefore, talking about speed, PHP wins by a significant margin over Python..However, it has to be noted that for most simple applications, the scale is quite low and so, there is not much of a noticeable time lag. For instance, for all practical purposes, 10 milliseconds is not much different from 30 milliseconds given that the application isn’t latency-critical..The most commonly used Python-based web frameworks are Django, Flask, Pylons, Pyramid, etc. On the other hand, the most used . are Codeigniter, Zend, Laravel, Symfony, etc..Django is known to be extremely fast, scalable, secure and easy-to-use. It is quite robust and powerful and is used widely in a large number of applications. Similarly, Codeigniter and Laravel are very widely used in the market and almost all PHP applications today use one of the above 2 frameworks..Python and PHP are both quite close on this point is given that both provide equally good choices. New developers, however, enjoy using Django given that the development time in Django is quite low and it is easy to set up..Python provides a powerful debugger called PDB (Python Debugger). PDB is well documented and is easy to use, even for beginners. PHP, on the other hand, provides XDebug package for debugging. Both PDB and XDebug provide the most commonly used debugging features - breakpoints, stacks, path mapping, etc. Both Python and PHP are similar here, and none is a clear winner..To summarize, for most points, both Python and PHP are similar to each other. For others, Python is better than PHP. Python seems to be a winner over PHP. Here is what we would recommend:.Entrepreneur, Coder, Speed-cuber, Blogger, fan of Air crash investigation! Aman Goel is a Computer Science Graduate from IIT Bombay. Fascinated by the world of technology he went on to build his own start-up - AllinCall Research and Solutions to build the next generation of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing based solutions to power businesses. . . This is a fundamentally dishonest post. You've ignored PHP 8, and just claimed Python is easier to learn, despite that not being the general public consensus whatsoever..\n.\nPHP has been considered the easiest language to exist since its birth. It was created to provide a simple language for new starters to learn. Python has dictionaries, tuples, and various other datatypes, along with various errors that are obscure to new programmers. PHP and JS both only have Array's and Objects. The two most popular languages in the world have recognised this..\n.\nAdditionally, you must consider PHP 8 which is in beta. A quick Ctrl+F shows 0 mention of it. The JIT compiler + Opcache, along with PHP's strict syntax means it can be executed extremely quickly compared even to PHP 7. .\n.\n.\n.  That's why all the programming contest pros use PHP. Oh wait, in fact they all use Python... . Hi Aman Goel,.\nPHP is a lot more easier to learn than Python, i learned it 10 years ago in a single week, PHP do not need more than a week. My serious approach with Python was last year, i wrote a lot Python code and I'm still not feeling confident with Python, there's no comparison..\n.\nTrends is an argument for low skilled programmers: trends represent the death of programming, like 20 years ago, when I started programming, flash and applets was trends on web, I've never used that crappy things, You all can continue follow trends (like Kubernetes, another crap), while smart people knows what to do. ;).\n.\nI did a lot of tests with both languages and I can say:.\n- if You work with web pages, PHP is overall the best language You can use...it's much better to not work with Python on web, it's not designed to do it..\n.\n- if You need something else, even something web related, like a bulk db import to run night time for example, Python runs faster..\n.\nPeace . PHP... cmon on... Its just a scripting language for web purposes. .  That is a old story. PHP nowadays are still in the game competing to provide high performance web apps . your comment looks like you are stuck with one language and not updating your self for a very long time. I am writing PHP and java both for a long time and I am seeing PHP improved a lot. Especially from 5.6 to 7.x  . Hello to every , because I am actually eager of reading this website's .\npost to be updated regularly. It consists of nice material. . You're so interesting! I do not think I've truly read anything .\nlike this before. So wonderful to discover somebody with a few original thoughts on this topic..\nReally.. thanks for starting this up. This website is something .\nthat's needed on the internet, someone with a bit of originality! . Way cool! Some extremely valid points! I appreciate you writing this post andd also the rest of .\nthe website is really good. . I wish I read the comments before I read the article :/ . Pls i have a very important question, is it possible for me to only learn one of the languages and completely avoid the other, and please if it's possible to focus on just one, which would should it be if i am thinking of just making a website that showcases my career as an Architect and the services i offer . I would suggest according to the trends, you need to go with Python then. . \"If you are an intermediate programmer, you might want to learn Python and shift to it for better job opportunities\".\n.\nYes, you will get more job opportunities if you know both. But this statement suggests that intermediate programmer should \"switch to\" python. I just want to clarify that PHP and Python both have lot of openings. If you know only PHP or Python, you won't remain jobless. If you know any one, I would in fact suggest to learn some Front End technology like React, Angular, Vue, etc. Just my personal thoughts. . This is the most pitiful defense of Python’s absolute unraveling, while PHP is doing laps around stratosphere bound rockets... ?? Like seriously, is PHP trying to take a shot at Java right now? Meanwhile Python3, (utterly incompatible with previous versions - oh, and how’s managing versions with Python again? That fun? No?) drags with fricking Ruby in performance, has no decent package manager (I don’t care what you say - outside node, no one does it worse - composer may play simple - but damn is ever effective). I just don’t get why people hype Python so much - I don’t even think it’s easy, JS got rid of semicolons because they’re pointless, that’s a sensible design decision, but know I’m hunting through my code for missing fucking white spaces instead of semicolons....... great, 1 step forward, 2 steps back ? .  Glad to see someone who thinks logically and understands things rather than believing on hypes. .Don't have an account? .Already have an account? .Didn’t recieve the password reset link?",

During the last few years, there has been a growing demand for such top-notch technologies as ML, AI, etc. Python also supports many huge machine learning libraries, which is a substantial advantage. What is more, the functionality of PHP is limited to web development only. At the same time, Python is good for web development and other services due to its universality and flexibility..Frameworks suggest a model for creating and launching websites or applications. During the development lifecycle, it is conducive as you don’t have to redevelop the functionality. At this point, PHP and Python are equal, as both of them offer robust and well-thought-out frameworks for website development. Creating a website with PHP is easy as it works with such powerful frameworks as .. Developers can also easily find help there. Python utilizes such web frameworks as Django that are rocket-fast, secure, and user-friendly. .It is impossible to write a good code without any issues or bugs right away. All the developers, especially beginners, seek help on the Internet. Each widely used coding language should have strong community support. Both Python and PHP have large and supportive communities, so if your product is a startup or you are not a pro in coding yet, you don’t have to worry. You can find qualified help quickly and easily..There is no universal answer to the question, “Which is better for web development: PHP or Python?” We won’t be radical because we realize that both Python and PHP are excellent website development choices..The very first thing you need to take into account is the specific requirements. For instance, if you need a more sophisticated e-commerce website and time isn’t a problem, go for PHP and enjoy its robust functionality. But, if you are interested in fast and effortless web development with a short and universal code, Python is the best solution. We hope this article gave you insight on picking the right option.

        "The goal of this course is to provide an in-depth introduction to the Python programming language followed by an introduction to both the Perl and PHP.  All of these languages share common functionality and are tools commonly used to solve similar problems, but each embodies a different philosophy and approach to solving those problems.  After a thorough grounding in the language's basics, we'll explore their similarities, and, more importantly, their differences.  By the end of the course, its' hoped, you'll have a good idea which of these tools is right for you and the kind of applications you wish to develop with them.",
        "PHP and Python are the popular high-level programming languages which have a strong open source background and also provide comprehensive design documentation. The major difference between PHP and Python is that PHP is broadly used for web development whereas Python is a general-purpose full-stack programming language. PHP is a server-side scripting language, in contrast, Python is an object-oriented scripting language..\n.\n. #tablepress-260 from cache .\n. development was initiated in 1994 by .. Earlier the acronym used for PHP was . which was replaced with . later. Its documentation is available online free of cost, as it is released in terms of an open source license. In the starting, the PHP doesn’t support object-oriented programming which was added in later versions..Most of the prevalent content management systems use PHP such as Media wiki, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress and so on which permit site creation without much programming skills. The main benefit of PHP is that it is available on each shared hosting provider. PHP is considered as most entrenched runtime environment on the server at present. It could provide better search engine rating and accessibility on hosting providers..The embedded code technique was devised by PHP so that the code is embedded directly into a content document. This code embedding technique was very effective for static and small web pages. Later the embedded code was replaced by template files as the web developed and applications got more and more complicated..The implicit type conversion is used in PHP hence it is a weak type system. For example, an integer and a string are comparable in a boolean expression; this could create confusion and uncertainty. There is another disadvantage of using integrated MYSQL database statements directly in the code because the database systems are tightly coupled to PHP by certain functions..Previously Object-oriented paradigms were not implemented in PHP, and it is easy to learn for novice coders. Its syntax is close to languages such as C and Java. PHP is very robust language that provide a strong user base and its distribution..PHP seems familiar language as it is originated from C based syntax. The later version of PHP supports object-oriented programming where code and modules comprised of functions are encapsulated into an object..The extensions are commonly used in PHP that cache compiled bytecode to prevent compiling of the source code on every single request..The development of . language is initiated in 1991, by .. It was devised as a fully features general purpose language unlike PHP it is not promisingly used as a web scripting language. The language has a defacto standard which was implemented by the python foundation..Python also does have an open source background similar to PHP. Although it offers a collaborated web framework which enhances its flexibility but it needs more programming efforts, Zope application server is mostly used python web framework. The benefit of python is on the discussion media ratings..The Python language doesn’t emphasize on the web application development. There used a different method for web frameworks such as CGI, WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) which can be helpful to change the environment and gateway of the web application without affecting the source code, which makes it portable. However, it is quite complex to use the WSGI for the novice programmers..Dissimilar to PHP, the Python language was designed with the employed object-oriented paradigm, in spite of this, it also supports procedural and functional programming. The syntax of python is simple and easy to learn. It has a strong type system and uses explicit techniques..Python is more readable than PHP as its commands resemble the words used in natural English language. It is aspect-oriented where the modules separate the functionality..Python also provides caching system known as memcached for web applications..The PHP and Python languages are used for different purposes, PHP is mostly used in web development whereas Python is a full-stack programming language utilized in engineering and science and graphics. Both languages have their respective advantages and disadvantages according to usage. However, Python is flexible while PHP is restricted in some way..Good info abt Python.Good Information shared.

        "Hi! I'm currently studying . for mobile apps, but I also have a demand to automate some tasks on the web and create backends' for my apps, so thinking about which one of those could be better? Considering the performance and how easy it's to learn and create stuff? (I'm already familiar with . stack but want something more \"simple\" to write).Definitely Python. Lots of libraries, dead simple syntax. Lots of code examples and reference projects. Elixir is pure functional and takes time to grasp the concepts. Go is great, with simple syntax and performant runtime, but more strict as it is statically typed. For quick coding, nothing beats Python. As you come from .net I’d consider similar approach and be considering Java with SpringBoot as it makes Java faster and much more fun to code web servers.Elixir really has a good performance for the web (and in general).\nIts framework Phoenix for the web is a great tool, easy to install and to use, with features for websockets (and Pub/Sub) or LiveView to write reactive and real time app with only HTML (and Elixir) so basically everything is in one place.It can take some time to learn a few things in Elixir but I really think it's worth it, and it's very easy to go distributed and concurrent with Elixir. Also it's easier to code quickly with some features like the pattern matching or some operators like the pipe or the capture one.And in the case you need it you can still connect and interface Python and Elixir pretty quickly, and now Elixir has a lot of different frameworks : web, embedded or even neural networks now.Never went far with Go but I have some trouble with its syntax, I find it a bit messy.I don't have a lot of experience with the web with Python but I don't have a good experience with the little I did.Hey Vitor, You can use Node and Express JS to create a backend for your app. You can create REST APIS to connect your front end with the backend. It is a very simple and scalable solution for building backend web apps. .Judging your previous experience we will benefit from Golang in terms of portability and speed. If you want to go simplier use Python. If it's only scripts use Python..What stack is a cryptocurrency exchange built upon? For example let's see Binance's page of BTC/USDT market. The order data refreshes in milliseconds, graphs refreshes in milliseconds, orders are placed in ms and everything moves well dynamically. How are they able to achieve it? What front-end framework might they be using? What backend framework for this kind of data, framework for matching engine, database for such heavy loads?.For such a more realtime-focused, data-centered application like an exchange, it's not the frontend or backend that matter much. In fact for that, they can do away with any of the popular frameworks like React/Vue/Angular for the frontend and Go/Python for the backend. For example uniswap's frontend (although much simpler than binance) is built in React. The main interesting part here would be how they are able to handle updating data so quickly. In my opinion,  they might be heavily reliant on realtime processing systems like Kafka+Kafka Streams, Apache Flink or Apache Spark Stream or similar. For more processing heavy but not so real-time processing, they might be relying on OLAP and/or warehousing tools like Cassandra/Redshift. They could have also optimized few high frequent queries using NoSQL stores like mongodb (for persistance) and in-memory cache like Redis (for further perfomance boost to get millisecond latencies)..While these tools are a great start, you are going to need low latency, and extremely high bandwidth. I couldn't see this happening without you having pretty much your own datacenter at your disposal. While the post below gives some great options, it's extremely apache-biased. Not saying apache is bad, but there are other options to explore. My recommendation is a mix of services from AWS, azure.. Whatever cloud service you choose to go with. You'll definitely need a streaming service.. Either self-built or cloud provided, and a restful API for things that don't quite require the power of a stream. Then, as you scale, you'll start to realize that even the best stacks in the world have bottlenecks, and you'll want to employ use of some type of messaging queue..I'm making my university community web service with a team. (6 members myself included) .And we decided to use ., HTML, CSS (for sure, it's the basic of websites) but couldn't decide for the back end part. .There are tons of languages, tools, etc., but I'm really new to programming, so I'd like to get some help to figure out what tools we need. .So my question is this: are there any good examples of web community services we can mimic the tools or get an insight from them? .Since you're following Python, I would recomend using Django as your main back-end language. If you know Python it would be a great experience.\nDjango is well documented on their official website:\n.\nI would also use React for front-end as well. \nAlso this article is worth reading, I think progressive web app is something worth learning these days:\n.\nHope that helps :).Since your team is already using JavaScript, there's a great number of examples for backend services written with NodeJS. I'd recommend using Firebase, or any backend as a service (you can use that term to find alternatives), for setting up your backend as it is much easier for newer people to understand and lets you focus on your core application logic, and not provisioning servers, databases, etc..Since you're team is already using JavaScript, there are alot of examples and open source projects written with NodeJs, so I preffer this language in your backend application and also I am recommended using Mongo DB with It for saving data in it, and also for your frontend application I am recommanded using VueJs..Since you are already using JavaScript on the front end it would be easy to adopt the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack which s all javascript based making it easy to transfer knowledge with the backend and front end.Make it simple, most of projects doesnt need a AI, ML or big algorithms.\nIf your project just serving end users take it to the web ready compatible. (Javascript, .Net, PHP Laravel).Kindly I don't find any help that solve this mystery I need more help if it will happen.Hello, I am interested in learning how to program. I am a beginner, and  many articles saying I should go with . if I am new to programming. I considered . a long time ago, but for my career, I believe major programming languages should be better for me. I'm considering Python at this moment, but if you have other tools I should use, let me know..The language you choose is also dependant on the type of career / area of programming you wish to focus on: Web Based and mobile applicaitons I would lean towards Java,  PC Applications I tend to like C#, \n Embedded industry C, C++.my advice , you should answer me for this question, what do you like to work: web base or mobile native or cross platform. if you like web base you should choose PHP or ASP.net or Node.js or if you like mobile native you should decide Android or IOS platform and else if you like cross platfrom you should learn Flutter with dart language.\nthanks.Hi there. I'm looking to build an employee time tracker web app. This should also be optimized for mobile. I'm trying to figure out what the best stack is for this. I have knowledge of ., ., some .. I don't mind learning a new language for this purpose. Any help or advice would be really awesome! Thanks..Hi Otensia! I'd definitely recommend using the skills you've already got and building with . is a smart way to go these days. Most platform services have JavaScript/Node SDKs or NPM packages, many serverless platforms support Node in case you need to write any backend logic, and JavaScript is incredibly popular - meaning it will be easy to hire for, should you ever need to..My advice would be \".\". If you already have a skill set that will work well to solve the problem at hand, and you don't need it for any other projects, don't spend the time jumping into a new language. If you're looking for an excuse to learn something new, it would be better to invest that time in learning a new platform/tool that compliments your knowledge of JavaScript. For this project, I might recommend using ., ., or Google . to quickly and easily deploy your web app. If you need to add user authentication, there are great examples out there for ., ., or even . (a newcomer on the Auth scene, but very user friendly). All of these services work very well with a JavaScript-based application..As you have knowledge of Javascript, I would go towards Vue/React in Frontend and Node (with suitable framework) with backend. From my point of view Java would be too bloated for suggested kind of an app. I myself use PHP as a backend a lot and React as frontend but moving thoughts towards full stack javascript world..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..php is the best for beginners, and one of the best for web development at all, all the host servers can handle it, a basic knowledge in java is not enough for build a web site, but a basic knowledge in php is enough. learn php basics and oop and mvc design pattern or any framework like Laravel (optional), and javascript for frontend (a framework like React or Angular is optional but good) and you will build any web site you want..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..For just a time tracker app? I'd recommend going with a cloud-based approach. A couple serverless functions in whatever language you choose, and the front end can be a static website hosted inside a storage service (blob for Azure, bucket for AWS, etc). This will ultimately probably save you a little time, and them a little money on hosting..Hey, 👋 .My name is Brayden. I’m currently a Frontend . Developer, striving to move into Fullstack so I can expand my knowledge. .For my main backend language, I am deciding between .. I’ve tried each of them out for about an hour and currently, I like Python and Rust the most. However, I’m not sure if I’m missing out on something!.If anyone has advice on these technologies, I’d love to hear it!.Thanks. .Rust is still in low demand. It's a great language but you'll have a hard time finding jobs. Go is the mix of both Rust and Python. Great language with modern features, fast, scalable, fun to write, and at the same time it has high demand (not as much as python)..Python on the other hand is a language that you can't go wrong with. Look around you and see what your job market prefers. If there isn't much difference to you personally, pick the one with more demand..All of these are solid options, however considering your expertise currently, I would probably suggest Node.JS considering your past experience with JS. However Python offers a similar development environment to JS in my opinion, and Go is a good sort of intermediate between Rust and Node.JS and Python. It's fast, but not as fast as Rust, and offers a development experience that combines C-styled languages (like Rust), and Python-y languages... So: Rust for the fastest, Node for familiarity, Python for ease of development, and Go for a good middle ground. I have used all in personal projects... If you use Go, I suggest a easy to use web server framework like Fiber..Rust is a challenging choice, but worth to be chosen. It has strong memory-safety and type-safety, this gives you no bother about those errors. However, static typing languages often slow our developing speed down in early stage. In that case, it's effective to write prototype in an easy language like Python, and rewrite it in a hard language. It's important not to be afraid to throw away first code you write..The other answers are excellent, but I want to be a bit of a contrarian and say you should learn Rust. While the number of jobs for it are (relatively) low(er), it is certainly expanding and you'd be surprised at which companies do use Rust (Discord, for example, is starting to move away from Golang to Rust!). .But the main reason is that learning Rust itself will teach you a lot about systems design (/backend) because of its borrow checker. You can try out a lot of ideas and make a lot mistakes and the borrow checker will always be there guide you to a better solution (thereby teaching you in the process). .Also, I wouldn't underestimated how important managing memory (and memory safety) is. While Golang is great in some ways, it doesn't protect you from pushing memory leaks into production. And eventually you'll come upon a scenario where you'll have to make your Python code run faster and the optimizations you'd have to do won't look pretty (or be very Pythontic). .And Rust is freakin fast! If you have Rust, you wouldn't need any other language for the backend (or any other systems level code). Check this blog post: .. Discord found that even after spending months optimizing Golang code it still wasn't fast enough. But unoptimized, first-draft Rust code was (is) faster by an order of magnitude! .Hi.I want to build a tool to check asset availability (video, images, etc.) from third-party vendors. These vendors have APIs. However, this process should run daily basis and update the database with the status. This is a kind of separate process. I need to know what will be the good approach and technology for this?.hi - I think this depends on how you want to provide the information to the user. \nIf you want to build a Wordpress-plugin: PHP\nIf you want to build your own website: Python+Django / PHP / JavaScript+Node.js\nAs Desktop application?.for what technologies you should use, this is depend on what technology do you prefer? your should think best structuing for your code because each API vendor has different to a nother one so it's better no merege code vendores  together.\nyour code must be using SOLID principle pattern and some design pattern such as Factory Pattern.The major advantage of Go is that you can run queries in parallel. Fire off a Go thread for each vendor and each thread can check the availability of assets from a specific vendor and update the database. Go supports hundreds of threads with ease..Hi, I would recommend Go because of strongly-typed nature which makes a developer more productive as it is less error prone compared to the other dynamic-typed language. Go also has cron-job library(powered by goroutines) that can help with your automated tasks..your decision depend on what language do you know. if you know php you can use laravel framework.I am technical support. I work daily with . / Exchange, Active directory. I would like to learn scripting and automation to make my life easier. I just started learning . but not really sure about the correct study path from where I can start. I am taking some courses on Udemy and YouTube. Is it enough? .My first foray into programming was with powershell and it continues to be an enormous help for me in my career (caveat being that I have primarily worked on windows boxes). That being said, PowerShell is a weird language that has some unique syntax and operators that don't translate well to other languages.  Python is weird too, but for other reasons (spacing!). I suspect you'll get more immediate benefit spending some time on Powershell since your working in an environment that fully supports the ps toolset. .As for learning, I read \"PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches\" and found that helpful. However, I think your course of study is sufficient.  Think the most return for the effort was just messing around in the powershell IDE on my local computer and working the Microsoft documentation. .Taking courses on Udemy and YouTube will be helpful I'm sure, but don't neglect the power of practice. If you work largely with Windows right now, pick powershell. Take opportunities to convert the knowledge you already have (example: unlocking an account in Active Directory or adding an email alias in Exchange) from a manual process to a powershell method. Sometimes that's a single cmdlet (Unlock-AdAccount) and sometimes it's a script..Once you have a good understanding of variables, the pipeline, and foreach loops, you'll be in a position to accelerate your learning. Looking up Microsoft docs is part of the process :).I would consider reading \"Powershell for sysadmins\" from No Starch Press. Start small with the ActiveDirectory and AzureAd modules. Start with read only operations like pulling AD Group Members into a variable and then pipe that variable into a .csv file with Export-CSV cmdlet. Once you feel more comfortable with the syntax, specific cmdlets, and piping data start looking at specific techniques like using hashtables (dictionaries) and globbing. From there you can begin to construct your own functions and modules. Just start small and don't let yourself get overwhelmed. .Hi Everyone,.I have some experience working with . and . and will now try to learn . - could you please share some similarities and differences between JS and C# and what rookie mistakes I should watch out for when learning C#?.Also, any tips & good practices are greatly appreciated :).Thank you .If you want to learn . to write some backend code you can also check out . which is basically JavaScript running outside the browser. You can create any kind of web servers, APIs, scrapers, automation scripts, etc using all the same JavaScript..A good entry to . is .. It is the most common web framework for .. It's well documented and there are a lot of educational materials for it..I prefer functional programming because it produces less buggy code (thus I recommend .), and is simply better to learn this paradigm earlier on in your coding career rather than later.

I urge you to learn it.I think you can manage to find something about this topic. it's pretty popular one.\nex: .Something I don't see discussed enough over the internet is the performance difference. I don't think you should worry about this. 95% of the time you won't notice the difference on your day to day projets. You will know what you need in terms of performance when you get there..I am a beginner, and I am totally confused, which of these 3 languages to learn first. \n., ., or .. As my studies are going which of them will be easy to learn with studies that is, I can learn and do my studies also. Which one of them will be easily handled with my studies, and will be much much useful in future?.python is a good language to start for the beginner..Python is a great language to learn as a beginner. However, Go is really easy to learn as well and has a much more powerful standard library that will allow you to build very complex and powerful applications in the future. Go is becoming a standard in Cloud computing and concurrency. Both of which are very advanced but important. .I'd definitely start with Go. I know Python, Go and quite a few other languages..Rust is not easy to learn as a beginner..Python has way too many features to be called \"easy\" to learn. While it is very forgiving to beginner mistakes it feels like playing in a puddle of mud. It does not teach you clean programming at all. Unless of course you like messy..Go on the other hand is very easy to learn. As a professional you can learn the entire language in under 2 hours. I have already given the tour of Go (.) to complete beginners and they went through it very thoroughly and thereby knew the entire Go language in less than 5 days. While it is very easy to learn and very easy to read, it is quite strict on other things, guiding you to write clean code. For one it is a typed language and it is good to learn very early about types..Knowing the entire language is of course not all there is to know. There is the standard library and a lot of other libraries to get to know in every language. Also one has to learn patterns in every language, get experience on how to structure code, dig deeper into the language itself to understand its inner workings, etc. That takes years in every language..That being said, it depends very much on what you want to do with a language. If you want to go into ML and science you definitely need Python. If you want to go into cloud computing, distributed servers (which in my opinion any server should be nowadays), use Go. If you want to do systems level programming, e.g in hardware programming, use Rust..I have experience in all three languages, and you should learn python first. These are three different languages (read: tools) to solve different problems you may have. \nPython is a high level language you can use for writing cross-platform scripts, web servers, AI, websites (e.g. Django) and the list goes on. Python can be used for most programming tasks while being the easiest to learn of the three and probably the most productive as well. .A lot of tech companies start out with Python for their web services, but due to Pythons slow speed and the pain that comes with dynamically typed languages when the code base grows, switch to Go later on when they need to scale. Go is a systems language that thrives when used for high performance cloud/web or networking services. Go is used in performance critical networking situations such as Twitch's streaming services and Uber's geofence services. It's also very clean and simple syntax that makes it very easy to quickly understand what code does..Python is an interpreted language and Go is a garbage collected language, but Rust is a highly performant and reliable compiled programming language without the extra baggage of runtime memory management. Rust forces you to follow coding patterns that assure memory safety. This makes Rust a perfect fit for high performance algorithms, game engines or safety-critical systems, but would be overkill for web servers or scripts on modern hardware..If all you want is a gentle intro and have access to tools and libs that can help with your tasks, Python is the way to go. It's ecosystem is huge and the language is easy to pick up. However, if you are aiming to get into software industry, I'd highly recommend you also pick up another classic language like C++/C#/Java. It really helps you cement some CS & programming fundamentals and get more familiar with the concept of software design and software architecture. Not saying you cannot achieve good architecture in Python or Go, but traditionally you have more materials covering these classic OOP languages. And once you learn them, you can apply your knowledge to other languages and it helps you understand other languages faster..Rust is probably a bad choice for starting out. It is a low level language where garbage collection is not done automatically, and has to get you thinking about all the technical aspects. It is statically typed and compiled, so it's very strict with how you code.\n I do love Rust though, it's a nice language.\nGolang is also compiled and statically typed, but it aims to be for quick development, which makes it a better choice for starting out..Python though can be great for starting out and getting a hold on how to program. You don't need to worry about things such as types, garbage collection, or an overwhelming amount of data types. \nSince I'm a JavaScript fanboy I can't help but say another great popular choice to start is JavaScript 😁.If you start learning programming I'd suggest Python language. I have no experience with Go and Rust so I cannot give you advice for them..Python has the broadest reach as it's been around the longest; rust is much more difficult for a beginner to learn; I work with Go every day and it's probably the most productive general use language..Learn/start with C; don't rush after buzz words. Python is easy to learn but you would not get the underpinnings of memory and pointers, an important aspect of programming. .I'd choose python because with a good knowledge of python and it's libraries, you could do literally anything. Also it has a relatively simple structure, so it won't be tough for a beginner. .Later on if you wish to learn Rust and Go, please do by all means..Study, machine learning = Python |\nHigh performance computing, safety-oriented programming = Rust |\nBackend, feel productive with less runtime performance drawback = Go.Go and Python are going to be much easier to learn than Rust. The memory management for Rust is pretty hard to wrap your head around when you are first learning how to do basic things with the language. Get familiar with programming first, then learn Rust. .I agree with most of the other answers here. Python is the best choice because it is super user-friendly, has an easy syntax, and can do many complex things in relatively fewer lines. .While Rust is a more recent and a great language nonetheless, it is slightly more complicated as it involves compiling and the syntax isn't so great. .And Go is the not a great choice either. While it has a decent syntax, keep in mind that Go won't be of much use unless you plan on working in Google. Even if you want to learn it, you can do so later..I hope this helped you in making your decision, and welcome to the world of programming! I hope you enjoy..Python is the easiest of the languages to learn, and while the slowest in production, it will teach many of the basic fundamental concepts of programming, especially if you're not going to be doing anything low level or at a system level..Python is a great language to start programming with, there is an awesome python course on coursera by Dr. Charles Severance called Programming for everybody, check it out :).Python, because its the easiest to learn as a beginer. Its often called \"English without grammar\" because its terms and writing style is quite similar to English. Python also has a diverse range of applications like Web App, Desktop App, Data Science etc.Python is the best programming language for starting out as it is quite easy to learn, but it also is very powerful and you can do plenty with it. It will be useful for a long time. Python is my recommendation..Python will be used in order to train machine learning models from our data.  We chose python for this task because it is the most common language for machine learning.  It has very performant libraries like numpy and scikit-learn that provide functionality for manipulating data and creating models that you cannot get in other languages like JavaScript and Java.  Additionally, it is the most familiar language for us to use for machine learning because almost every machine learning course teaches ml using python..Javascript will be used for both our frontend and backend on the web service.  JavaScript is ubiquitous as the language to use for the frontend.  For the backend, we decided to create our server using JavaScript because of its easy setup; using Express we can create a server in just a few short lines of code.  It is simple not only to run the server locally, but to host it as well because any major service will support the language.  JavaScript is a simple language to code in and familiar among our team members, so using it will help speed up development.  Using JavaScript allows us to use NodeJS and npm, so we can use packages to easily set up the server, connect to a database and other convenient utilities.  We also considered Python for our server.  It is also very simple to create a server in Python, especially using flask.  However, the extra familiarity with the JavaScript language and the ease of using packages were enough for us to pick JavaScript as our language of choice.. .Python is the default go-to for machine learning. It has a wide variety of useful packages such as pandas and numpy to aid with ML, as well as deep-learning frameworks. Furthermore, it is more production-friendly compared to other ML languages such as R..Pytorch is a deep-learning framework that is both flexible and fast compared to Tensorflow + Keras. It is also well documented and has a large community to answer lingering questions. .Python: The top language in machine learning area because of the various open-source libraries. Our company will rely on open-source libraries for development as well..Amazon EC2: Training machine learning model needs to be running on independent 3rd party computing resources.

So a hybrid application approach is the best because it allows you to develop a cross-platform application in a unique codebase. \nThe choice behind Ionic is Angular, I think that angular is the best framework to develop a complex application that needs a lot of service interaction, its modularity forces you (the developer) to write the code in the correct way, so it can be maintainable and reusable..I had a . to create the simplest accounting software for Mac and Windows to help small businesses in Canada..This led me to a long 2 years of exploration of the best language that could provide these features:.I tried Python, Java, C# and C++ without finding what I was looking for..When I discovered Javascript, I really knew it was the right language to use. Thinking of this today makes me realize even more how great a decision this has been to learn, use and master Javascript. It has been a fun, challenging and productive road on which I am still satisfied. .Obviously, when I refer to Javascript, it is not without implying the vast ecosystem around it. For me, JS is a whole universe in which almost every imaginable tools exist. It's awesome - for real. Thanks to all the contributors which have made it possible. .To be even clearer about how intense I am with Javascript, let's just say that my first passion was music. Until, I find coding with Javascript! Yep, I know!.So in conclusion, I chose Javascript because it is versatile, enjoyable, widely used, productive for both desktop softwares and websites with ability to create modern great looking user interfaces (assuming HTML and CSS are involved) and finally there are job openings..Simple Customer Registration Crud, with the functions of Register, Delete, Edit and List new and old customers registered in the Database.

Foi utilizado como SGBD o PostgreSQL, pelo seu facil uso e praticidade..Python has become the most popular language for machine learning right now since almost all machine learning tools provide service for this language, and it is really to use since it has many build-in objects like Hashtable. In C, you need to implement everything by yourself. .C++ is one of the most popular programming languages in graphics. It has many fancy libraries like eigen to help us process matrix. I have many previous projects about graphics based on C++ and this time, we also need to deal with graphics since we need to analyze movements of the human body. C++ has much more advantages than Java. C++ uses only compiler, whereas Java uses compiler and interpreter in both. C++ supports both operator overloading and method overloading whereas Java only supports method overloading. C++ supports manual object management with the help of new and delete keywords whereas Java has built-in automatic garbage collection..Pinterest.WorkOS.Pinterest.Rancher Labs.Pinterest.Red Hat, Inc..LogRocket.CloudSponge",
        "Hi! I'm currently studying . for mobile apps, but I also have a demand to automate some tasks on the web and create backends' for my apps, so thinking about which one of those could be better? Considering the performance and how easy it's to learn and create stuff? (I'm already familiar with . stack but want something more \"simple\" to write).Definitely Python. Lots of libraries, dead simple syntax. Lots of code examples and reference projects. Elixir is pure functional and takes time to grasp the concepts. Go is great, with simple syntax and performant runtime, but more strict as it is statically typed. For quick coding, nothing beats Python. As you come from .net I’d consider similar approach and be considering Java with SpringBoot as it makes Java faster and much more fun to code web servers.Elixir really has a good performance for the web (and in general).\nIts framework Phoenix for the web is a great tool, easy to install and to use, with features for websockets (and Pub/Sub) or LiveView to write reactive and real time app with only HTML (and Elixir) so basically everything is in one place.It can take some time to learn a few things in Elixir but I really think it's worth it, and it's very easy to go distributed and concurrent with Elixir. Also it's easier to code quickly with some features like the pattern matching or some operators like the pipe or the capture one.And in the case you need it you can still connect and interface Python and Elixir pretty quickly, and now Elixir has a lot of different frameworks : web, embedded or even neural networks now.Never went far with Go but I have some trouble with its syntax, I find it a bit messy.I don't have a lot of experience with the web with Python but I don't have a good experience with the little I did.Hey Vitor, You can use Node and Express JS to create a backend for your app. You can create REST APIS to connect your front end with the backend. It is a very simple and scalable solution for building backend web apps. .Judging your previous experience we will benefit from Golang in terms of portability and speed. If you want to go simplier use Python. If it's only scripts use Python..What stack is a cryptocurrency exchange built upon? For example let's see Binance's page of BTC/USDT market. The order data refreshes in milliseconds, graphs refreshes in milliseconds, orders are placed in ms and everything moves well dynamically. How are they able to achieve it? What front-end framework might they be using? What backend framework for this kind of data, framework for matching engine, database for such heavy loads?.For such a more realtime-focused, data-centered application like an exchange, it's not the frontend or backend that matter much. In fact for that, they can do away with any of the popular frameworks like React/Vue/Angular for the frontend and Go/Python for the backend. For example uniswap's frontend (although much simpler than binance) is built in React. The main interesting part here would be how they are able to handle updating data so quickly. In my opinion,  they might be heavily reliant on realtime processing systems like Kafka+Kafka Streams, Apache Flink or Apache Spark Stream or similar. For more processing heavy but not so real-time processing, they might be relying on OLAP and/or warehousing tools like Cassandra/Redshift. They could have also optimized few high frequent queries using NoSQL stores like mongodb (for persistance) and in-memory cache like Redis (for further perfomance boost to get millisecond latencies)..While these tools are a great start, you are going to need low latency, and extremely high bandwidth. I couldn't see this happening without you having pretty much your own datacenter at your disposal. While the post below gives some great options, it's extremely apache-biased. Not saying apache is bad, but there are other options to explore. My recommendation is a mix of services from AWS, azure.. Whatever cloud service you choose to go with. You'll definitely need a streaming service.. Either self-built or cloud provided, and a restful API for things that don't quite require the power of a stream. Then, as you scale, you'll start to realize that even the best stacks in the world have bottlenecks, and you'll want to employ use of some type of messaging queue..I'm making my university community web service with a team. (6 members myself included) .And we decided to use ., HTML, CSS (for sure, it's the basic of websites) but couldn't decide for the back end part. .There are tons of languages, tools, etc., but I'm really new to programming, so I'd like to get some help to figure out what tools we need. .So my question is this: are there any good examples of web community services we can mimic the tools or get an insight from them? .Since you're following Python, I would recomend using Django as your main back-end language. If you know Python it would be a great experience.\nDjango is well documented on their official website:\n.\nI would also use React for front-end as well. \nAlso this article is worth reading, I think progressive web app is something worth learning these days:\n.\nHope that helps :).Since your team is already using JavaScript, there's a great number of examples for backend services written with NodeJS. I'd recommend using Firebase, or any backend as a service (you can use that term to find alternatives), for setting up your backend as it is much easier for newer people to understand and lets you focus on your core application logic, and not provisioning servers, databases, etc..Since you're team is already using JavaScript, there are alot of examples and open source projects written with NodeJs, so I preffer this language in your backend application and also I am recommended using Mongo DB with It for saving data in it, and also for your frontend application I am recommanded using VueJs..Since you are already using JavaScript on the front end it would be easy to adopt the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack which s all javascript based making it easy to transfer knowledge with the backend and front end.Make it simple, most of projects doesnt need a AI, ML or big algorithms.\nIf your project just serving end users take it to the web ready compatible. (Javascript, .Net, PHP Laravel).Kindly I don't find any help that solve this mystery I need more help if it will happen.Hello, I am interested in learning how to program. I am a beginner, and  many articles saying I should go with . if I am new to programming. I considered . a long time ago, but for my career, I believe major programming languages should be better for me. I'm considering Python at this moment, but if you have other tools I should use, let me know..The language you choose is also dependant on the type of career / area of programming you wish to focus on: Web Based and mobile applicaitons I would lean towards Java,  PC Applications I tend to like C#, \n Embedded industry C, C++.my advice , you should answer me for this question, what do you like to work: web base or mobile native or cross platform. if you like web base you should choose PHP or ASP.net or Node.js or if you like mobile native you should decide Android or IOS platform and else if you like cross platfrom you should learn Flutter with dart language.\nthanks.Hi there. I'm looking to build an employee time tracker web app. This should also be optimized for mobile. I'm trying to figure out what the best stack is for this. I have knowledge of ., ., some .. I don't mind learning a new language for this purpose. Any help or advice would be really awesome! Thanks..Hi Otensia! I'd definitely recommend using the skills you've already got and building with . is a smart way to go these days. Most platform services have JavaScript/Node SDKs or NPM packages, many serverless platforms support Node in case you need to write any backend logic, and JavaScript is incredibly popular - meaning it will be easy to hire for, should you ever need to..My advice would be \".\". If you already have a skill set that will work well to solve the problem at hand, and you don't need it for any other projects, don't spend the time jumping into a new language. If you're looking for an excuse to learn something new, it would be better to invest that time in learning a new platform/tool that compliments your knowledge of JavaScript. For this project, I might recommend using ., ., or Google . to quickly and easily deploy your web app. If you need to add user authentication, there are great examples out there for ., ., or even . (a newcomer on the Auth scene, but very user friendly). All of these services work very well with a JavaScript-based application..As you have knowledge of Javascript, I would go towards Vue/React in Frontend and Node (with suitable framework) with backend. From my point of view Java would be too bloated for suggested kind of an app. I myself use PHP as a backend a lot and React as frontend but moving thoughts towards full stack javascript world..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..php is the best for beginners, and one of the best for web development at all, all the host servers can handle it, a basic knowledge in java is not enough for build a web site, but a basic knowledge in php is enough. learn php basics and oop and mvc design pattern or any framework like Laravel (optional), and javascript for frontend (a framework like React or Angular is optional but good) and you will build any web site you want..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..For just a time tracker app? I'd recommend going with a cloud-based approach. A couple serverless functions in whatever language you choose, and the front end can be a static website hosted inside a storage service (blob for Azure, bucket for AWS, etc). This will ultimately probably save you a little time, and them a little money on hosting..Hey, 👋 .My name is Brayden. I’m currently a Frontend . Developer, striving to move into Fullstack so I can expand my knowledge. .For my main backend language, I am deciding between .. I’ve tried each of them out for about an hour and currently, I like Python and Rust the most. However, I’m not sure if I’m missing out on something!.If anyone has advice on these technologies, I’d love to hear it!.Thanks. .Rust is still in low demand. It's a great language but you'll have a hard time finding jobs. Go is the mix of both Rust and Python. Great language with modern features, fast, scalable, fun to write, and at the same time it has high demand (not as much as python)..Python on the other hand is a language that you can't go wrong with. Look around you and see what your job market prefers. If there isn't much difference to you personally, pick the one with more demand..All of these are solid options, however considering your expertise currently, I would probably suggest Node.JS considering your past experience with JS. However Python offers a similar development environment to JS in my opinion, and Go is a good sort of intermediate between Rust and Node.JS and Python. It's fast, but not as fast as Rust, and offers a development experience that combines C-styled languages (like Rust), and Python-y languages... So: Rust for the fastest, Node for familiarity, Python for ease of development, and Go for a good middle ground. I have used all in personal projects... If you use Go, I suggest a easy to use web server framework like Fiber..Rust is a challenging choice, but worth to be chosen. It has strong memory-safety and type-safety, this gives you no bother about those errors. However, static typing languages often slow our developing speed down in early stage. In that case, it's effective to write prototype in an easy language like Python, and rewrite it in a hard language. It's important not to be afraid to throw away first code you write..The other answers are excellent, but I want to be a bit of a contrarian and say you should learn Rust. While the number of jobs for it are (relatively) low(er), it is certainly expanding and you'd be surprised at which companies do use Rust (Discord, for example, is starting to move away from Golang to Rust!). .But the main reason is that learning Rust itself will teach you a lot about systems design (/backend) because of its borrow checker. You can try out a lot of ideas and make a lot mistakes and the borrow checker will always be there guide you to a better solution (thereby teaching you in the process). .Also, I wouldn't underestimated how important managing memory (and memory safety) is. While Golang is great in some ways, it doesn't protect you from pushing memory leaks into production. And eventually you'll come upon a scenario where you'll have to make your Python code run faster and the optimizations you'd have to do won't look pretty (or be very Pythontic). .And Rust is freakin fast! If you have Rust, you wouldn't need any other language for the backend (or any other systems level code). Check this blog post: .. Discord found that even after spending months optimizing Golang code it still wasn't fast enough. But unoptimized, first-draft Rust code was (is) faster by an order of magnitude! .Hi.I want to build a tool to check asset availability (video, images, etc.) from third-party vendors. These vendors have APIs. However, this process should run daily basis and update the database with the status. This is a kind of separate process. I need to know what will be the good approach and technology for this?.hi - I think this depends on how you want to provide the information to the user. \nIf you want to build a Wordpress-plugin: PHP\nIf you want to build your own website: Python+Django / PHP / JavaScript+Node.js\nAs Desktop application?.for what technologies you should use, this is depend on what technology do you prefer? your should think best structuing for your code because each API vendor has different to a nother one so it's better no merege code vendores  together.\nyour code must be using SOLID principle pattern and some design pattern such as Factory Pattern.The major advantage of Go is that you can run queries in parallel. Fire off a Go thread for each vendor and each thread can check the availability of assets from a specific vendor and update the database. Go supports hundreds of threads with ease..Hi, I would recommend Go because of strongly-typed nature which makes a developer more productive as it is less error prone compared to the other dynamic-typed language. Go also has cron-job library(powered by goroutines) that can help with your automated tasks..your decision depend on what language do you know. if you know php you can use laravel framework.I am technical support. I work daily with . / Exchange, Active directory. I would like to learn scripting and automation to make my life easier. I just started learning . but not really sure about the correct study path from where I can start. I am taking some courses on Udemy and YouTube. Is it enough? .My first foray into programming was with powershell and it continues to be an enormous help for me in my career (caveat being that I have primarily worked on windows boxes). That being said, PowerShell is a weird language that has some unique syntax and operators that don't translate well to other languages.  Python is weird too, but for other reasons (spacing!). I suspect you'll get more immediate benefit spending some time on Powershell since your working in an environment that fully supports the ps toolset. .As for learning, I read \"PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches\" and found that helpful. However, I think your course of study is sufficient.  Think the most return for the effort was just messing around in the powershell IDE on my local computer and working the Microsoft documentation. .Taking courses on Udemy and YouTube will be helpful I'm sure, but don't neglect the power of practice. If you work largely with Windows right now, pick powershell. Take opportunities to convert the knowledge you already have (example: unlocking an account in Active Directory or adding an email alias in Exchange) from a manual process to a powershell method. Sometimes that's a single cmdlet (Unlock-AdAccount) and sometimes it's a script..Once you have a good understanding of variables, the pipeline, and foreach loops, you'll be in a position to accelerate your learning. Looking up Microsoft docs is part of the process :).I would consider reading \"Powershell for sysadmins\" from No Starch Press. Start small with the ActiveDirectory and AzureAd modules. Start with read only operations like pulling AD Group Members into a variable and then pipe that variable into a .csv file with Export-CSV cmdlet. Once you feel more comfortable with the syntax, specific cmdlets, and piping data start looking at specific techniques like using hashtables (dictionaries) and globbing. From there you can begin to construct your own functions and modules. Just start small and don't let yourself get overwhelmed. .Hi Everyone,.I have some experience working with . and . and will now try to learn . - could you please share some similarities and differences between JS and C# and what rookie mistakes I should watch out for when learning C#?.Also, any tips & good practices are greatly appreciated :).Thank you .If you want to learn . to write some backend code you can also check out . which is basically JavaScript running outside the browser. You can create any kind of web servers, APIs, scrapers, automation scripts, etc using all the same JavaScript..A good entry to . is .. It is the most common web framework for .. It's well documented and there are a lot of educational materials for it..I prefer functional programming because it produces less buggy code (thus I recommend .), and is simply better to learn this paradigm earlier on in your coding career rather than later. It can also do most stuff . can do, namely code with .. If you're going to learn . then you should learn .+. first though before doing web development with ./.C# is .net framework of a programming language specially different from the programming languages you're used to. If you learn C# you will be experienceed in coding with VIsual Basic .net and also creating web development using ASP and this ASP also include JavaScript function.... I urge you to learn it.I think you can manage to find something about this topic. it's pretty popular one.\nex: .Something I don't see discussed enough over the internet is the performance difference. I don't think you should worry about this. 95% of the time you won't notice the difference on your day to day projets. You will know what you need in terms of performance when you get there..I am a beginner, and I am totally confused, which of these 3 languages to learn first. \n., ., or .. As my studies are going which of them will be easy to learn with studies that is, I can learn and do my studies also. Which one of them will be easily handled with my studies, and will be much much useful in future?.python is a good language to start for the beginner..Python is a great language to learn as a beginner. However, Go is really easy to learn as well and has a much more powerful standard library that will allow you to build very complex and powerful applications in the future. Go is becoming a standard in Cloud computing and concurrency. Both of which are very advanced but important. .I'd definitely start with Go. I know Python, Go and quite a few other languages..Rust is not easy to learn as a beginner..Python has way too many features to be called \"easy\" to learn. While it is very forgiving to beginner mistakes it feels like playing in a puddle of mud. It does not teach you clean programming at all. Unless of course you like messy..Go on the other hand is very easy to learn. As a professional you can learn the entire language in under 2 hours. I have already given the tour of Go (.) to complete beginners and they went through it very thoroughly and thereby knew the entire Go language in less than 5 days. While it is very easy to learn and very easy to read, it is quite strict on other things, guiding you to write clean code. For one it is a typed language and it is good to learn very early about types..Knowing the entire language is of course not all there is to know. There is the standard library and a lot of other libraries to get to know in every language. Also one has to learn patterns in every language, get experience on how to structure code, dig deeper into the language itself to understand its inner workings, etc. That takes years in every language..That being said, it depends very much on what you want to do with a language. If you want to go into ML and science you definitely need Python. If you want to go into cloud computing, distributed servers (which in my opinion any server should be nowadays), use Go. If you want to do systems level programming, e.g in hardware programming, use Rust..I have experience in all three languages, and you should learn python first. These are three different languages (read: tools) to solve different problems you may have. \nPython is a high level language you can use for writing cross-platform scripts, web servers, AI, websites (e.g. Django) and the list goes on. Python can be used for most programming tasks while being the easiest to learn of the three and probably the most productive as well. .A lot of tech companies start out with Python for their web services, but due to Pythons slow speed and the pain that comes with dynamically typed languages when the code base grows, switch to Go later on when they need to scale. Go is a systems language that thrives when used for high performance cloud/web or networking services. Go is used in performance critical networking situations such as Twitch's streaming services and Uber's geofence services. It's also very clean and simple syntax that makes it very easy to quickly understand what code does..Python is an interpreted language and Go is a garbage collected language, but Rust is a highly performant and reliable compiled programming language without the extra baggage of runtime memory management. Rust forces you to follow coding patterns that assure memory safety. This makes Rust a perfect fit for high performance algorithms, game engines or safety-critical systems, but would be overkill for web servers or scripts on modern hardware..If all you want is a gentle intro and have access to tools and libs that can help with your tasks, Python is the way to go. It's ecosystem is huge and the language is easy to pick up. However, if you are aiming to get into software industry, I'd highly recommend you also pick up another classic language like C++/C#/Java. It really helps you cement some CS & programming fundamentals and get more familiar with the concept of software design and software architecture. Not saying you cannot achieve good architecture in Python or Go, but traditionally you have more materials covering these classic OOP languages. And once you learn them, you can apply your knowledge to other languages and it helps you understand other languages faster..Rust is probably a bad choice for starting out.

Python is easy to learn but you would not get the underpinnings of memory and pointers, an important aspect of programming. .I'd choose python because with a good knowledge of python and it's libraries, you could do literally anything. Also it has a relatively simple structure, so it won't be tough for a beginner. .Later on if you wish to learn Rust and Go, please do by all means..Study, machine learning = Python |\nHigh performance computing, safety-oriented programming = Rust |\nBackend, feel productive with less runtime performance drawback = Go.Go and Python are going to be much easier to learn than Rust. The memory management for Rust is pretty hard to wrap your head around when you are first learning how to do basic things with the language. Get familiar with programming first, then learn Rust. .I agree with most of the other answers here. Python is the best choice because it is super user-friendly, has an easy syntax, and can do many complex things in relatively fewer lines. .While Rust is a more recent and a great language nonetheless, it is slightly more complicated as it involves compiling and the syntax isn't so great. .And Go is the not a great choice either. While it has a decent syntax, keep in mind that Go won't be of much use unless you plan on working in Google. Even if you want to learn it, you can do so later..I hope this helped you in making your decision, and welcome to the world of programming! I hope you enjoy..Python is the easiest of the languages to learn, and while the slowest in production, it will teach many of the basic fundamental concepts of programming, especially if you're not going to be doing anything low level or at a system level..Python is a great language to start programming with, there is an awesome python course on coursera by Dr. Charles Severance called Programming for everybody, check it out :).Python, because its the easiest to learn as a beginer. Its often called \"English without grammar\" because its terms and writing style is quite similar to English. Python also has a diverse range of applications like Web App, Desktop App, Data Science etc.Python is the best programming language for starting out as it is quite easy to learn, but it also is very powerful and you can do plenty with it. It will be useful for a long time. Python is my recommendation..Python will be used in order to train machine learning models from our data.  We chose python for this task because it is the most common language for machine learning.  It has very performant libraries like numpy and scikit-learn that provide functionality for manipulating data and creating models that you cannot get in other languages like JavaScript and Java.  Additionally, it is the most familiar language for us to use for machine learning because almost every machine learning course teaches ml using python..Javascript will be used for both our frontend and backend on the web service.  JavaScript is ubiquitous as the language to use for the frontend.  For the backend, we decided to create our server using JavaScript because of its easy setup; using Express we can create a server in just a few short lines of code.  It is simple not only to run the server locally, but to host it as well because any major service will support the language.  JavaScript is a simple language to code in and familiar among our team members, so using it will help speed up development.  Using JavaScript allows us to use NodeJS and npm, so we can use packages to easily set up the server, connect to a database and other convenient utilities.  We also considered Python for our server.  It is also very simple to create a server in Python, especially using flask.  However, the extra familiarity with the JavaScript language and the ease of using packages were enough for us to pick JavaScript as our language of choice.. .Python is the default go-to for machine learning. It has a wide variety of useful packages such as pandas and numpy to aid with ML, as well as deep-learning frameworks. Furthermore, it is more production-friendly compared to other ML languages such as R..Pytorch is a deep-learning framework that is both flexible and fast compared to Tensorflow + Keras. It is also well documented and has a large community to answer lingering questions. .Python: The top language in machine learning area because of the various open-source libraries. Our company will rely on open-source libraries for development as well..Amazon EC2: Training machine learning model needs to be running on independent 3rd party computing resources. AWS EC2 can provide a variety of virtual computing resources based on what users need..React+Javascript: React is popular and everyone in the team is familiar with it. React is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications..ExpressJS: Everyone in the team has used expressJS for development. It can create server-side web applications faster and smarter..Amazon RDS: relational database service and free to use.Postman: Tool for the team to test API endpoint..Circle CI: is lightweight and open. Therefore for faster deployment jobs, one can execute their codes on CircleCI as it deploys on scalable and robust cloud servers..Docker: Easily pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container, which can run virtually anywhere.Github+Git: Julian is from Github so no other choice for us 😎.Slack: Everyone likes it and it's free.Python: Top one language in machine learning area because of the various open source libraries.

So a hybrid application approach is the best because it allows you to develop a cross-platform application in a unique codebase. \nThe choice behind Ionic is Angular, I think that angular is the best framework to develop a complex application that needs a lot of service interaction, its modularity forces you (the developer) to write the code in the correct way, so it can be maintainable and reusable..I had a . to create the simplest accounting software for Mac and Windows to help small businesses in Canada..This led me to a long 2 years of exploration of the best language that could provide these features:.I tried Python, Java, C# and C++ without finding what I was looking for..When I discovered Javascript, I really knew it was the right language to use. Thinking of this today makes me realize even more how great a decision this has been to learn, use and master Javascript. It has been a fun, challenging and productive road on which I am still satisfied. .Obviously, when I refer to Javascript, it is not without implying the vast ecosystem around it. For me, JS is a whole universe in which almost every imaginable tools exist. It's awesome - for real. Thanks to all the contributors which have made it possible. .To be even clearer about how intense I am with Javascript, let's just say that my first passion was music. Until, I find coding with Javascript! Yep, I know!.So in conclusion, I chose Javascript because it is versatile, enjoyable, widely used, productive for both desktop softwares and websites with ability to create modern great looking user interfaces (assuming HTML and CSS are involved) and finally there are job openings..Simple Customer Registration Crud, with the functions of Register, Delete, Edit and List new and old customers registered in the Database. PostgreSQL was used as DBMS, due to its easy use and practicality..Crud de Cadastro a Clientes simples, com as funções de Registrar, Deletar, Editar e Listar novos e antigos clientes cadastrado no Banco de Dados. Foi utilizado como SGBD o PostgreSQL, pelo seu facil uso e praticidade..Python has become the most popular language for machine learning right now since almost all machine learning tools provide service for this language, and it is really to use since it has many build-in objects like Hashtable. In C, you need to implement everything by yourself. .C++ is one of the most popular programming languages in graphics. It has many fancy libraries like eigen to help us process matrix. I have many previous projects about graphics based on C++ and this time, we also need to deal with graphics since we need to analyze movements of the human body. C++ has much more advantages than Java. C++ uses only compiler, whereas Java uses compiler and interpreter in both. C++ supports both operator overloading and method overloading whereas Java only supports method overloading. C++ supports manual object management with the help of new and delete keywords whereas Java has built-in automatic garbage collection..Pinterest.WorkOS.Pinterest.Rancher Labs.Pinterest.Red Hat, Inc..LogRocket.CloudSponge",
        "Hello everyone! I’m interested in learning AI development, and after doing a little bit of research, I’ve learned that . and . are the top languages for AI. Which one should I learn? What are the differences? Are they hard to learn? If anyone can help with this, it’d be very appreciated. Thank you!.Java is far more popular and you can use other JVM-based languages such as Kotlin (I would recommend Kotlin over Java). Also, for Java, there are many more libraries, tools, etc. Also, if you learn Java, you can do almost anything - mobile (Android), web, and desktop apps - without \"hacks\". There is native support for all of these..As with any programming language, it's not hard to learn the syntax but it's hard to understand the ecosystem, know libraries, best practices, etc. From that point of view, I would also prefer java - more tools, more libraries, more resources, guides, how-tos, etc. .Hi\nExcuse me if I wrote the text badly because I do not know much English\nMy suggestion is to choose Python for artificial intelligence because it has both comfortable and powerful syntax.\nPython is currently the best language for artificial intelligence\nIt is better to go and learn Python and then learn one of the artificial intelligence frameworks and enter it..I'd recommend Python due to the fact that many AI libraries and frameworks are specifically developed for the Python ecosystem. .Java is good for general purpose programming: Web, Mobile and Desktop, however doesn't really have many native libraries supporting AI Development..As for LISP, again it has some support,, however Python seems to be the leading edge in AI development.I have not much idea about Lisp, but have been a Java professional since last 20 odd years. And I would say Java along with Python is one of the best languages for AI..AI works on the concept of algorithms, and Java is algorithm based. Also Java has it's own AI libraries that can be reused. You have Java AI libraries for Expert Systems, Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing..Also Java being a widely used language, brings with it certain advantages, ease of usage, debugging, has a large user base and support groups. And above all JVM helps you to create on single app, that can run on any platform. And it's features of garbage collection, simplifying work with large scale projects makes it better..Hope this helps..Hi! I'm currently studying . for mobile apps, but I also have a demand to automate some tasks on the web and create backends' for my apps, so thinking about which one of those could be better? Considering the performance and how easy it's to learn and create stuff? (I'm already familiar with . stack but want something more \"simple\" to write).Definitely Python. Lots of libraries, dead simple syntax. Lots of code examples and reference projects. Elixir is pure functional and takes time to grasp the concepts. Go is great, with simple syntax and performant runtime, but more strict as it is statically typed. For quick coding, nothing beats Python. As you come from .net I’d consider similar approach and be considering Java with SpringBoot as it makes Java faster and much more fun to code web servers.Elixir really has a good performance for the web (and in general).\nIts framework Phoenix for the web is a great tool, easy to install and to use, with features for websockets (and Pub/Sub) or LiveView to write reactive and real time app with only HTML (and Elixir) so basically everything is in one place.It can take some time to learn a few things in Elixir but I really think it's worth it, and it's very easy to go distributed and concurrent with Elixir. Also it's easier to code quickly with some features like the pattern matching or some operators like the pipe or the capture one.And in the case you need it you can still connect and interface Python and Elixir pretty quickly, and now Elixir has a lot of different frameworks : web, embedded or even neural networks now.Never went far with Go but I have some trouble with its syntax, I find it a bit messy.I don't have a lot of experience with the web with Python but I don't have a good experience with the little I did.Hey Vitor, You can use Node and Express JS to create a backend for your app. You can create REST APIS to connect your front end with the backend. It is a very simple and scalable solution for building backend web apps. .Judging your previous experience we will benefit from Golang in terms of portability and speed. If you want to go simplier use Python. If it's only scripts use Python..What stack is a cryptocurrency exchange built upon? For example let's see Binance's page of BTC/USDT market. The order data refreshes in milliseconds, graphs refreshes in milliseconds, orders are placed in ms and everything moves well dynamically. How are they able to achieve it? What front-end framework might they be using? What backend framework for this kind of data, framework for matching engine, database for such heavy loads?.For such a more realtime-focused, data-centered application like an exchange, it's not the frontend or backend that matter much. In fact for that, they can do away with any of the popular frameworks like React/Vue/Angular for the frontend and Go/Python for the backend. For example uniswap's frontend (although much simpler than binance) is built in React. The main interesting part here would be how they are able to handle updating data so quickly. In my opinion,  they might be heavily reliant on realtime processing systems like Kafka+Kafka Streams, Apache Flink or Apache Spark Stream or similar. For more processing heavy but not so real-time processing, they might be relying on OLAP and/or warehousing tools like Cassandra/Redshift. They could have also optimized few high frequent queries using NoSQL stores like mongodb (for persistance) and in-memory cache like Redis (for further perfomance boost to get millisecond latencies)..While these tools are a great start, you are going to need low latency, and extremely high bandwidth. I couldn't see this happening without you having pretty much your own datacenter at your disposal. While the post below gives some great options, it's extremely apache-biased. Not saying apache is bad, but there are other options to explore. My recommendation is a mix of services from AWS, azure.. Whatever cloud service you choose to go with. You'll definitely need a streaming service.. Either self-built or cloud provided, and a restful API for things that don't quite require the power of a stream. Then, as you scale, you'll start to realize that even the best stacks in the world have bottlenecks, and you'll want to employ use of some type of messaging queue..I'm making my university community web service with a team. (6 members myself included) .And we decided to use ., HTML, CSS (for sure, it's the basic of websites) but couldn't decide for the back end part. .There are tons of languages, tools, etc., but I'm really new to programming, so I'd like to get some help to figure out what tools we need. .So my question is this: are there any good examples of web community services we can mimic the tools or get an insight from them? .Since you're following Python, I would recomend using Django as your main back-end language. If you know Python it would be a great experience.\nDjango is well documented on their official website:\n.\nI would also use React for front-end as well. \nAlso this article is worth reading, I think progressive web app is something worth learning these days:\n.\nHope that helps :).Since your team is already using JavaScript, there's a great number of examples for backend services written with NodeJS. I'd recommend using Firebase, or any backend as a service (you can use that term to find alternatives), for setting up your backend as it is much easier for newer people to understand and lets you focus on your core application logic, and not provisioning servers, databases, etc..Since you're team is already using JavaScript, there are alot of examples and open source projects written with NodeJs, so I preffer this language in your backend application and also I am recommended using Mongo DB with It for saving data in it, and also for your frontend application I am recommanded using VueJs..Since you are already using JavaScript on the front end it would be easy to adopt the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack which s all javascript based making it easy to transfer knowledge with the backend and front end.Make it simple, most of projects doesnt need a AI, ML or big algorithms.\nIf your project just serving end users take it to the web ready compatible. (Javascript, .Net, PHP Laravel).Kindly I don't find any help that solve this mystery I need more help if it will happen.Hello, I am interested in learning how to program. I am a beginner, and  many articles saying I should go with . if I am new to programming. I considered . a long time ago, but for my career, I believe major programming languages should be better for me. I'm considering Python at this moment, but if you have other tools I should use, let me know..The language you choose is also dependant on the type of career / area of programming you wish to focus on: Web Based and mobile applicaitons I would lean towards Java,  PC Applications I tend to like C#, \n Embedded industry C, C++.my advice , you should answer me for this question, what do you like to work: web base or mobile native or cross platform. if you like web base you should choose PHP or ASP.net or Node.js or if you like mobile native you should decide Android or IOS platform and else if you like cross platfrom you should learn Flutter with dart language.\nthanks.Hi there. I'm looking to build an employee time tracker web app. This should also be optimized for mobile. I'm trying to figure out what the best stack is for this. I have knowledge of ., ., some .. I don't mind learning a new language for this purpose. Any help or advice would be really awesome! Thanks..Hi Otensia! I'd definitely recommend using the skills you've already got and building with . is a smart way to go these days. Most platform services have JavaScript/Node SDKs or NPM packages, many serverless platforms support Node in case you need to write any backend logic, and JavaScript is incredibly popular - meaning it will be easy to hire for, should you ever need to..My advice would be \".\". If you already have a skill set that will work well to solve the problem at hand, and you don't need it for any other projects, don't spend the time jumping into a new language. If you're looking for an excuse to learn something new, it would be better to invest that time in learning a new platform/tool that compliments your knowledge of JavaScript. For this project, I might recommend using ., ., or Google . to quickly and easily deploy your web app. If you need to add user authentication, there are great examples out there for ., ., or even . (a newcomer on the Auth scene, but very user friendly). All of these services work very well with a JavaScript-based application..As you have knowledge of Javascript, I would go towards Vue/React in Frontend and Node (with suitable framework) with backend. From my point of view Java would be too bloated for suggested kind of an app. I myself use PHP as a backend a lot and React as frontend but moving thoughts towards full stack javascript world..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..php is the best for beginners, and one of the best for web development at all, all the host servers can handle it, a basic knowledge in java is not enough for build a web site, but a basic knowledge in php is enough. learn php basics and oop and mvc design pattern or any framework like Laravel (optional), and javascript for frontend (a framework like React or Angular is optional but good) and you will build any web site you want..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..For just a time tracker app? I'd recommend going with a cloud-based approach. A couple serverless functions in whatever language you choose, and the front end can be a static website hosted inside a storage service (blob for Azure, bucket for AWS, etc). This will ultimately probably save you a little time, and them a little money on hosting..Hey, 👋 .My name is Brayden. I’m currently a Frontend . Developer, striving to move into Fullstack so I can expand my knowledge. .For my main backend language, I am deciding between .. I’ve tried each of them out for about an hour and currently, I like Python and Rust the most. However, I’m not sure if I’m missing out on something!.If anyone has advice on these technologies, I’d love to hear it!.Thanks. .Rust is still in low demand. It's a great language but you'll have a hard time finding jobs. Go is the mix of both Rust and Python. Great language with modern features, fast, scalable, fun to write, and at the same time it has high demand (not as much as python)..Python on the other hand is a language that you can't go wrong with. Look around you and see what your job market prefers. If there isn't much difference to you personally, pick the one with more demand..All of these are solid options, however considering your expertise currently, I would probably suggest Node.JS considering your past experience with JS. However Python offers a similar development environment to JS in my opinion, and Go is a good sort of intermediate between Rust and Node.JS and Python. It's fast, but not as fast as Rust, and offers a development experience that combines C-styled languages (like Rust), and Python-y languages... So: Rust for the fastest, Node for familiarity, Python for ease of development, and Go for a good middle ground. I have used all in personal projects... If you use Go, I suggest a easy to use web server framework like Fiber..Rust is a challenging choice, but worth to be chosen. It has strong memory-safety and type-safety, this gives you no bother about those errors. However, static typing languages often slow our developing speed down in early stage. In that case, it's effective to write prototype in an easy language like Python, and rewrite it in a hard language. It's important not to be afraid to throw away first code you write..The other answers are excellent, but I want to be a bit of a contrarian and say you should learn Rust. While the number of jobs for it are (relatively) low(er), it is certainly expanding and you'd be surprised at which companies do use Rust (Discord, for example, is starting to move away from Golang to Rust!). .But the main reason is that learning Rust itself will teach you a lot about systems design (/backend) because of its borrow checker. You can try out a lot of ideas and make a lot mistakes and the borrow checker will always be there guide you to a better solution (thereby teaching you in the process). .Also, I wouldn't underestimated how important managing memory (and memory safety) is. While Golang is great in some ways, it doesn't protect you from pushing memory leaks into production. And eventually you'll come upon a scenario where you'll have to make your Python code run faster and the optimizations you'd have to do won't look pretty (or be very Pythontic). .And Rust is freakin fast! If you have Rust, you wouldn't need any other language for the backend (or any other systems level code). Check this blog post: .. Discord found that even after spending months optimizing Golang code it still wasn't fast enough. But unoptimized, first-draft Rust code was (is) faster by an order of magnitude! .Hi.I want to build a tool to check asset availability (video, images, etc.) from third-party vendors. These vendors have APIs. However, this process should run daily basis and update the database with the status. This is a kind of separate process. I need to know what will be the good approach and technology for this?.hi - I think this depends on how you want to provide the information to the user. \nIf you want to build a Wordpress-plugin: PHP\nIf you want to build your own website: Python+Django / PHP / JavaScript+Node.js\nAs Desktop application?.for what technologies you should use, this is depend on what technology do you prefer? your should think best structuing for your code because each API vendor has different to a nother one so it's better no merege code vendores  together.\nyour code must be using SOLID principle pattern and some design pattern such as Factory Pattern.The major advantage of Go is that you can run queries in parallel. Fire off a Go thread for each vendor and each thread can check the availability of assets from a specific vendor and update the database. Go supports hundreds of threads with ease..Hi, I would recommend Go because of strongly-typed nature which makes a developer more productive as it is less error prone compared to the other dynamic-typed language. Go also has cron-job library(powered by goroutines) that can help with your automated tasks..your decision depend on what language do you know. if you know php you can use laravel framework.I was thinking about adding a new technology to my current stack (. and .). But, I want a compiled language, mainly for speed and scalability reasons compared to interpreted languages. I have tried each one (., ., and .). I loved them, and I don't know which one can offer me more opportunities for the future (I'm in my first year of software engineering at university)..Which language should I choose?.I will highly recommend Kotlin.\nI have worked with all three intensely and so far the development speed and simplicity is the best with Kotlin.\nKotlin supports . out of the box. Now, it isn't something that can't be implemented in other languages but Kotlin makes it super easy to work with them.\nKotlin has a bit of learning curve, so, by the time you can actually use it idiomatically chances are that you will get proficient in Java too. But once you get it, you get it, then there is no other language ;)\nKotlin is backed by Google and Jetbrains team so you can expect latest programming features and good community support..As you certainly know, there are languages that compile in meta-code for Virtual Machines (Java, C#, Kotlin) and languages that compile in Machine Language (Go, Rust). Apart specific domains (blockchain, IoT embedded software, AI, cloud) almost no-one uses languages that compile in machine language, for a series of reason, most of all security and portability. So, if you are going to learn for business go with Kotlin - Java is a bit ancien regime.\nIf you seriously need to learn a language that compiles in ML - for example you will code for IoT - go with Go - or Rust - but keep in mind that Rust is much less used than Go.\nPS: Kotlin also compiles in ML, but I would choose a language designed for that, instead of one that compiles \"also\" in ML.\nPPS: Some Virtual Machines - ie: GraalVM - allow you to compile Java in ML. The world of IT is beautiful..I'd say Rust's knowledge will be more valuable in comparison. You can work in Blockchain development,  compile to WASM (WebAssembly). There is a new JavaScript/TypeScript runtime named Deno (by the creator of Node.js) that has its backend in Rust. .It depends on which level and use cases you prefer to work at. Close to the machine? Rust is great but if you need to find more job opportunities, then take C/C++. Java has many job positions but I suggest Kotlin over it. Think about it as a better Java, but fewer job positions.\nDo you want to do your own projects? So a productive language like Ruby is way better. Like to program front-end apps? Take JS.\nFind your passion..If you want a compiled language then go for Rust. It takes a certain mindset to get your head around its memory management system and the way it handles \"borrowed\" memory. However, it will generate blindingly fast code that you can cross-compile for other platforms. As a systems programming language I highly recommend it. Take time and learn it. .Java is only compiled to bytecode, not to machine code. So it executes in the Java Virtual Machine. DOn't think that its not fast, because the latest incarnation are very fast indeed. For most practical purposes, users of your code won't notice any difference. There are a heck of a lot of features in Java that you either have to import via crates in Rust, or write yoursef. So productivity-wise, Java may well beat Rust. .Kotlin is a Java-lookalike. It's a nice, and succinct version of Java and is totally interoperable. But its a bit niche, and for me it fails because my dev environment of choice (Spring Tool Suite) doesn't really play well with Kotlin. To use it you would be well advised to use iDeaj. I have used kotlin, and I like it, but not enough to ditch all my Java code. .Other contenders, depending on your platform of choice are Golang,  C, C++, and C# (available as Mono on Linux systems).  .I use Rust and Java and if you need a compiled language I recommend Rust. .I'd recommend you to take a look at Java and Kotlin, the first due to the number of companies that actively use it in your products. Kotlin is gaining adept since it is fully compatibly with the Java ecosystem but usually requires less code to do the same (ignoring other benefits of the language). Another benefits of the Kotlin is that it is in fact multiplatform, where you could use the same syntax to code for mobile, web and backend applications.\nThe drawback of Kotlin, is the number of open jobs that exists currently compared to Java, but I pretty sure that it will change in the near future..All those are nice languages, but Rust is harder to learn properly and has a smaller ecosystem. If you want to work in system programming (like hardware drivers) Rust is probably your choice. Otherwise, Java/Kotlin ecosystem is much larger and gives much more possibilities (maybe excluding low-level system programming). .When talking about Kotlin and Java, both are good. But Kotlin, again, gives much more opportunities. Kotlin-JS gives you browser applications, Kotlin-Native allows to compile to native application (and interop with them). Kotlin-WASM will be available shortly. Rust is better than Kotlin-Native for native development tight now, but not by far and it makes sense only if you are focusing only on native development..I would go with Kotlin. It is pretty hyped currently..You can use Kotlin for a lot of application types. To name some:.The code is also really concise, readable and modern. It also provides many features that you will find in many other programming languages. .I am technical support. I work daily with . / Exchange, Active directory. I would like to learn scripting and automation to make my life easier. I just started learning . but not really sure about the correct study path from where I can start. I am taking some courses on Udemy and YouTube. Is it enough? .My first foray into programming was with powershell and it continues to be an enormous help for me in my career (caveat being that I have primarily worked on windows boxes). That being said, PowerShell is a weird language that has some unique syntax and operators that don't translate well to other languages.  Python is weird too, but for other reasons (spacing!). I suspect you'll get more immediate benefit spending some time on Powershell since your working in an environment that fully supports the ps toolset. .As for learning, I read \"PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches\" and found that helpful. However, I think your course of study is sufficient.  Think the most return for the effort was just messing around in the powershell IDE on my local computer and working the Microsoft documentation. .Taking courses on Udemy and YouTube will be helpful I'm sure, but don't neglect the power of practice. If you work largely with Windows right now, pick powershell. Take opportunities to convert the knowledge you already have (example: unlocking an account in Active Directory or adding an email alias in Exchange) from a manual process to a powershell method. Sometimes that's a single cmdlet (Unlock-AdAccount) and sometimes it's a script..Once you have a good understanding of variables, the pipeline, and foreach loops, you'll be in a position to accelerate your learning. Looking up Microsoft docs is part of the process :).I would consider reading \"Powershell for sysadmins\" from No Starch Press. Start small with the ActiveDirectory and AzureAd modules. Start with read only operations like pulling AD Group Members into a variable and then pipe that variable into a .csv file with Export-CSV cmdlet. Once you feel more comfortable with the syntax, specific cmdlets, and piping data start looking at specific techniques like using hashtables (dictionaries) and globbing. From there you can begin to construct your own functions and modules. Just start small and don't let yourself get overwhelmed. .Python will be used in order to train machine learning models from our data.  We chose python for this task because it is the most common language for machine learning.  It has very performant libraries like numpy and scikit-learn that provide functionality for manipulating data and creating models that you cannot get in other languages like JavaScript and Java.  Additionally, it is the most familiar language for us to use for machine learning because almost every machine learning course teaches ml using python..Javascript will be used for both our frontend and backend on the web service.  JavaScript is ubiquitous as the language to use for the frontend.  For the backend, we decided to create our server using JavaScript because of its easy setup; using Express we can create a server in just a few short lines of code.  It is simple not only to run the server locally, but to host it as well because any major service will support the language.  JavaScript is a simple language to code in and familiar among our team members, so using it will help speed up development.  Using JavaScript allows us to use NodeJS and npm, so we can use packages to easily set up the server, connect to a database and other convenient utilities.  We also considered Python for our server.  It is also very simple to create a server in Python, especially using flask.  However, the extra familiarity with the JavaScript language and the ease of using packages were enough for us to pick JavaScript as our language of choice.. .Python is the default go-to for machine learning. It has a wide variety of useful packages such as pandas and numpy to aid with ML, as well as deep-learning frameworks. Furthermore, it is more production-friendly compared to other ML languages such as R..Pytorch is a deep-learning framework that is both flexible and fast compared to Tensorflow + Keras. It is also well documented and has a large community to answer lingering questions. .Python: The top language in machine learning area because of the various open-source libraries.

I have been working with React Native since 2016 and originally I had to use simulators in Xcode, install pods on top of node packages, configure certificates, and more abundant objectives that take time away from actual development. As a development studio, we have to move quick and get projects to our clients and partners in a matter of months..Expo made this easy for us. We now have a mobile app for clients to download and test their project on, there is no need to install pods or configure Xcode, and development is super fast and reliable now..I had a . to create the simplest accounting software for Mac and Windows to help small businesses in Canada..This led me to a long 2 years of exploration of the best language that could provide these features:.I tried Python, Java, C# and C++ without finding what I was looking for..When I discovered Javascript, I really knew it was the right language to use. Thinking of this today makes me realize even more how great a decision this has been to learn, use and master Javascript. It has been a fun, challenging and productive road on which I am still satisfied. .Obviously, when I refer to Javascript, it is not without implying the vast ecosystem around it. For me, JS is a whole universe in which almost every imaginable tools exist. It's awesome - for real. Thanks to all the contributors which have made it possible. .To be even clearer about how intense I am with Javascript, let's just say that my first passion was music. Until, I find coding with Javascript! Yep, I know!.So in conclusion, I chose Javascript because it is versatile, enjoyable, widely used, productive for both desktop softwares and websites with ability to create modern great looking user interfaces (assuming HTML and CSS are involved) and finally there are job openings..Python has become the most popular language for machine learning right now since almost all machine learning tools provide service for this language, and it is really to use since it has many build-in objects like Hashtable. In C, you need to implement everything by yourself. .C++ is one of the most popular programming languages in graphics. It has many fancy libraries like eigen to help us process matrix. I have many previous projects about graphics based on C++ and this time, we also need to deal with graphics since we need to analyze movements of the human body. C++ has much more advantages than Java. C++ uses only compiler, whereas Java uses compiler and interpreter in both. C++ supports both operator overloading and method overloading whereas Java only supports method overloading. C++ supports manual object management with the help of new and delete keywords whereas Java has built-in automatic garbage collection..Go is a way faster than both Python and PHP, which is pretty understandable, but we were amazed at how good we adapted to use it. Go was a blessing for a team , since strict typing is making it very easy to develop and control everything inside team, so the quality was really good. We made huge leap forward in dev speed because of it..Pinterest.Pinterest.Pinterest.WorkOS.Pinterest.Rancher Labs.Red Hat, Inc..HashiCorp",

        "Hi Guys we are going to build two Sci-Fi based Dev-Environments using CSS 3D and React that are geared towards focused development projects related to full-stack web interfaces and back-ends with PHP Python NodeJs and GoLang.  There first interface is a cube that can be rotated to a certain panel of choice. Each panel on the cube represents a connection to a specific language back-end like Node, PHP, Go, or PHP. These back-ends are Asynchronous focused WebSocket connections that can talk to the appropriate front end panel managed by a React Context. This allows for fast testing of technologies with these languages in a Sci-Fi based theme for some added fun React. Likewise the second Interface is a rotated Pentagon with panels configured to speak to there respective back-ends. This leaves room for the choice of authentication mechanisms and what topic you would like to continue your efforts of study in once the interfaces and there back-ends are up and running and communicating. Overall technologies included is Linux, Nginx, React, PHP, NodeJs, GoLang, Python, and PHP. .. I love guitars and coding. I am an introvert and have had a passion for coding since I was 13. I hope you learn a lot from these courses I try to express certain unique concepts with each course and bring over 20 years of trial and error to the table. ",

        "\n.It may come as a surprise to many, but at least half of the programming languages were not created in the United States. However, most people involved in the digital landscape, technologists, programmers using these technologies do not know anything about their founders. That’s why, in our latest article, we decided to cite some of the most important figures from the world of technology and talk about their history. .So let’s get to the point of this article..Guido van Rossum, the creator of the well-known . language, was born in the Netherlands on January 31, 1956. At the University of Amsterdam in 1982, he received a master’s degree in mathematics and computer science. Over the years, he worked at research centres, including the Center Wiskunde & Informatica, where he developed the ABC programming language..Van Rossum began designing Python in 1989. At first, he treated the project as a hobbyist activity after work. He worked on this side project for nearly 10 years. Python was released in version 1.0 in 1994 as an open-source project, which means that any person can modify and improve it freely. Van Rossum’s vision was to make the project intuitive. Over the years, Python has grown in popularity, and today it is one of the most widely used languages in the world. According to the TIOBE index (a survey of the popularity of programming languages), Python was in the fourth position in December 2017..: the name Python comes from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” – a comedy series that aired in the 1970s..Van Rossum is the head of the Python Software Foundation, an organization that promotes the preservation and development of this technology. Guido has also received the title of “Benevolent Dictator for Life”, which emphasizes how important and influential he is in the world of this technology. It also gives him the ability to make key decisions on contentious issues related to Python..Guido van Rossum is also responsible for creating Mondrian (a code review tool used by Google) and Rietveld. He has been a resident of the United States since 1995. For seven years from 2005, he was an employee of Google, and since January 2013, he was associated with Dropbox, where he holds the position of Principal Engineer. In 2021, he announced that he was joining the Developer Division at Microsoft..Rasmus Lerdorf is a programmer who was born on November 22, 1968, in Qeqertarsuaq, Greenland. He is responsible for creating the first two versions of the . language. Lerdorf also participated in the development of subsequent versions of the language..The original version of PHP, the Personal Home Page was created in 1994. Lerdorf created a set of Perl scripts to monitor Internet users visiting his website. When the traffic exceeded his expectations, he rewrote them in C while adding new features. Before long, he made it available to a wider audience so that people could use it on their sites. PHP Tools 1.0 was released on June 8, 1995. This was when Lerdorf made its source code public. The PHP language was created for designing websites and simple web applications..According to Rasmus, programming is boring and tedious, so he decided to create his language. It was supposed to make web design more dynamic and faster. Many years have passed since the original version of PHP, and the language has been repeatedly changed and improved. The latest version is PHP 8, which was released on November 26, 2020. Currently, PHP is one of the dominant technologies in the market and even covers about 75% of all web domains. Facebook was written in PHP, which was then translated using a proprietary tool – HipHop for PHP to C++..Rasmus Lerdorf has worked at Yahoo since 2002 for over 7 years as a Distinguished Engineer, where he oversaw the architecture and security issues of the Yahoo platform. From 2010 to 2017, he also worked at WePay. He has also managed startups such as Etsy and Room77 since their inception..: MIT Technology Review magazine listed him as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35..Brendon Eich is a programmer of American descent, born on July 4, 1961, in Pittsburgh. In 1995, he created the scripting programming language JavaScript. Its first version hit the market after only 10 days..JavaScript was supposed to make web pages more interactive and dynamic. Interestingly, the name of this technology came about as a result of a marketing gimmick. While ., Eich was doing press for Netscape, which decided to capitalize on the worldwide success of Java software. Despite appearances, the two technologies Java and JavaScript, are not related. The only thing they have in common is that every word was popular at the time..JavaScript combined elements of several other programming languages, and its application was to create dynamic web pages. Over the years, it started to be used for designing web and desktop applications as well. It was developed as a scripting language for a virtual machine to provide mechanisms for communication with the outside world. The most popular virtual machine is the browser, but JavaScript interpreters can be found in Adobe Acrobat or Photoshop..After leaving Netscape in 2003, Eich joined Mozilla as Chief Architect. He went through his entire career path there, as he was elected CEO of the company in 2014. Brendan Eich became the CEO of Mozilla on March 24, 2014, but he stepped down after 2. This is due to the infamous notoriety that he covered himself with after the homophonic statements that the browser users revealed. It came to light that he supported a legislative initiative that sought to prevent the introduction of same-sex marriage. Since 2015, he has been the CEO of Brave Software, which created the ad-free web browser..: Within 30 seconds of launching, he raised nearly $35 million from the community to develop the Brave browser..As you can see from the map above, the creators of popular technologies are not just concentrated in one place. Even in faraway Greenland, Great Minds are born who can influence the work of people around the world..The creator of Vue.js is Evan You, a well-known personality among developers, as he is also behind other recognizable projects in the tech world, including Angular.js. You are a young Chinese man who went to the United States to study. However, he did his bachelor’s degree in Art History. It wasn’t until he finished the undergraduate degree that he realized it wasn’t what he wanted to do. He chose Design and Technology as his major, where he first learned to design applications and interfaces..You had the opportunity to participate in Program Five from Google Creative Lab. At Google, he used Angular extensively, which he really appreciated, but he also saw the potential for change. So after hours, he created his project, which was supposed to combine all the advantages of Angular and correct what was wrong. In July 2013, ., which has gained a lot of popularity over time..Vue.js is a very flexible, intuitive, and transparent framework distinguished by many add-ons and features that others do not have. The big advantage of this technology is its continuous development, thanks to the ever-growing community..Vue.js, along with React.js and Angular.js, is the most popular JavaScript-based frameworks for building dynamic user interfaces. This technology allows you to create both simple components, advanced and web applications, and even mobile applications..The developer of ReactJS, a popular JavaScript application, is Jordan Walke, a graduate of the University of Washington. Today, . on giant platforms such as Netflix, Imgur, and PayPal. In Facebook, Jordan Walke was employed at this time, React.js was founded in 2011. The JavaScript library is called React.js, which is used to create dynamic interfaces. Walke aimed at streamlining the interface construction process so that developers can find it more simple and easy..React.js was originally meant to use only on Facebook, but it was straightforward to watch the light of day. It was launched in 2013 as an open-source, and it was a turning point. Since then, popularity has increased exponentially..Walke recently revealed that he was leaving Facebook after more than a decade of working as a computing developer. However, in a Twitter article, he stated that he did not withdraw, but he intends to start his own company. The precise specifics have, however, not been revealed..Taylor Otwell is a US software developer best known for the PHP web platform in Laravel. To build a more sophisticated alternative to the CodeIgniter platform, Otwell ., which lacked features, including built-in user authentication support and permissions. On 9 June 2011, Laravel’s first beta was announced. Little Rock, Arkansas, is located in Otwell..Laravel 2 was published by the author and by the group in September 2011. Important new features included controller support, Laravel 2 as a completely MVC-compliant, built-in IoC, and a template framework known as the Blade. In Laravel 2, third-party kit assistance has been deleted..Currently, Laravel is launched in version 7 on 3 March 2020. New features such as Laravel sanctum, customized elocution casts, blade marks, fluid string operations, and road model linking enhancements are part of the latest edition..: Furthermore, he created laracasts.com where he hosts Laravel video tutorials and other web technologies..SensioLabs is the developer of the popular PHP framework – Symfony. The company offers various types of services and training. The company . for programmers and enterprises to improve the quality, productivity, direction, and deployment of PHP applications, such as SensioLabsInsight, launched in 2014..: The name SensioLabs was created from the Spanish word “sencillo” meaning “simple”..Most interesting facts about the company:.The Angular history begins in 2009, with Miško Hevery and Adam Abrons working together on an hours-long side-project. In October 2010, GitHub publicly released the first stable version of the AngularJS, release 0.9.0, under the MIT license and had taken a great deal since..Misko has created a forum to deal with HTML deficiencies by bringing suggestions and best practices from other previously diverse libraries. . was a good one because its features made Misko popular with other web developers. But it needed a name that Adam Abrons had to shoulder to get the project off the ground. He thought that because HTML uses curly brackets, their common “side-project,” which means “angular,” could only be called angular. It wasn’t long, and the word got flesh. Www.GetAngular.com has been licensed..Miśko Hevery is now an Agile Coach at Google, where he trains Google staff to keep an automated testing community at a high standard. In the past, Adobe, Sun Microsystems, Intel, or Xerox have worked for him. He has been a specialist in web apps in Java, JavaScript, Flex, ActionScript, and many other technologies through these activities..Matthew Mullenweg is an American entrepreneur, born on January 11, 1984, in Houston. He is known for ., which The WordPress Foundation currently operates. He attended High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, where he studied jazz saxophone. However, in 2004, he dropped out and studied at the University of Houston to find CNET Networks. He worked until he founded Automattic in late 2005, which includes WordPress.com, Akismet, Gravatar, VaultPress, IntenseDebate, Crowdsignal, and Tumblr..His history with WordPress began when he went on a trip to Washington, DC. He wanted to share photos of his friends and family, so he posted them on Movable Type. He then noticed how many limitations this software had, so he started creating his own. Furthermore, he noticed that the b2 / catalogue blog system was released under the GNU General Public License. So he started to develop a new system based on it..In a short period, Mike Little joined the work. It was together with him that Mullenweg created the first version of WordPress. At that time, Movable Type – a popular blogging system – became more expensive, so users started looking for something new. This is what the success of WordPress was based on. Many users then tried the new platform..: WordPress version 1.5, which was released in February 2005, already had over 900,000 downloads..\r\n                                                Are you interested in news from the world of software development?

The block ends with the first line that is not indented further than the initial line. Python raises an IndentationError if the statements in the block that are not in a nested block are not all indented the same. Using tabs in Python source code is unrecommended and many editors replace them automatically with spaces. If the Python interpreter encounters a tab, it is treated as 8 spaces..The python repl switches from a . prompt to a … prompt inside a block. A blank line terminates the block..Colons are also used to separate keys from values in dictionary literals and in sequence slice notation..Curly brackets {} delimit blocks.

If a string belongs to the set, the string and regex \"match\". Regexes can also be used to parse strings..The modern notation for regexes was introduced by Unix command line tools in the 1970s. POSIX standardized the notation into two types: extended regexes and the more archaic basic regexes. Perl regexes are extended regexes augmented by new character class abbreviations and a few other features introduced by the Perl interpreter in the 1990s. All the languages in this sheet use Perl regexes..Any string that doesn't contain regex metacharacters is a regex which matches itself. The regex metacharacters are: .A character class is a set of characters in brackets: . When used in a regex it matches any character it contains..Character classes have their own set of metacharacters: .The . is only special when it is the first character in the character class. Such a character class matches its complement; that is, any character not inside the brackets. When not the first character the . refers to itself..The hyphen is used to specify character ranges: e.g. . or .. When the hyphen is first or last inside the brackets it matches itself..The backslash can be used to escape the above characters or the terminal character class delimiter: .. It can be used in character class abbreviations or string backslash escapes..The period . is a character class abbreviation which matches any character except for newline. In all languages the period can be made to match all characters. PHP uses the . modifier. Python uses the . flag. Ruby uses the . modifier..\n.The vertical pipe | is used for alternation and parens () for grouping..A vertical pipe takes as its arguments everything up to the next vertical pipe, enclosing paren, or end of string..Parentheses control the scope of alternation and the quantifiers described below. They are also used for capturing groups, which are the substrings which matched parenthesized parts of the regular expression. Each language numbers the groups and provides a mechanism for extracting them when a match is made. A parenthesized subexpression can be removed from the groups with this syntax: .As an argument quantifiers take the preceding regular character, character class, or group. The argument can itself be quantified, so that . matches strings with the letter a in multiples of 4..When there is a choice, greedy quantifiers will match the maximum possible number of occurrences of the argument. Lazy quantifiers match the minimum possible number..To match a metacharacter, put a backslash in front of it. To match a backslash use two backslashes..PHP 5.3 still supports the EREG engine, though the functions which use it are deprecated. These include the . function and functions which start with ..

A data type which combines both date and time information is convenient, but ISO 8601 doesn't provide a name for such an entity. PHP, Python, and C# use the compound noun . for combined date and time values and we adopt it here as a generic term..An useful property of . is that they are correctly ordered by a lexical sort on their string representations. This is because they are big-endian (the year is the leftmost element) and they used fixed-length, zero-padded fields with numerical values for each term in the string representation..The C standard library provides two methods for representing dates. The first is the ., which is the seconds since the beginning of January 1, 1970 in UTC. If such a time were stored in a 32-bit signed integer, the rollover would happen on January 18, 2038. The Unix epoch is an example of a ., in which the value is stored as a single numeric value representing the difference in time in some unit from a specially designated datetime called the epoch..Another serial datetime is the ., which is the number of 100 nanosecond intervals since the beginning of January 1, 1601 UTC. It was introduced when journaling was added to NTFS as part of the Windows 2000 launch..Some serial datetimes use days as the unit. The Excel . is the number of days since December 31, 1899. The ., used in astronomy, is the number of days since November 24, 4714 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. Julian days start at noon GMT..A . uses multiple numeric values to represent the components of a calendar date and time. An example from the C standard library is the . struct, a definition of which can be found on Unix systems in .:.The Linux man pages call the . struct a \"broken-down\" date and time, whereas the BSD man pages call it a \"broken-out\" date and time..The first day in the Gregorian calendar was 15 October 1582. The . is an extension of the Gregorian calendar to earlier dates. When such dates are used, they should be called out to be precise. The epoch in the proleptic Gregorian calendar is the year 0001, also written 1 AD or 1 CE. The previous year is the year 0000, also written 1 BC or 1 BCE. The year before that is the year -0001, also written 2 BC or 2 BCE. The ISO 8601 standard recommends that years before 0000 or after 9999 be written with a plus or minus sign prefix..An . is a broken-down date consisting of a year, followed by the day of the year. The ISO 8601 standard recommends that it be written in . or . format. The corresponding . formats are . and ...A . is a type of calendar which uses the year, week of the year, and day of the week to refer to to dates. In the ISO 8601 week date, the first week of the year is the week starting from Monday which contains January 4th. An ISO 8601 week date can thus have a different year number than the corresponding Gregorian date. The first week of the year is numbered ., and the first day of the week, Monday, is numbered .. Weeks are written in . or . format, where the upper case W is literal. The corresponding . literals are . and ...Common years have 365 days and leap years have 366 days. The extra day in February 29th. Leap years are years divisible by 4 but not 100, or years divisible by 400..In 1967, the definition of a second was changed from 1/86,400 of a solar day to a value expressed in terms of radiation produced by .Cs. Because the length of a solar day is irregular, leap seconds are occasionally used to keep things in sync. This is accomplished by occasionally adding a leap second to the end of June 30th or December 31st. The system also allows for removing the last second of June 30th or December 31st, though as of 2014 this hasn't been done..The data type used to hold a combined date and time..Python uses and exposes the . struct of the C standard library.

A time interval can also be defined by date and time representing the start of the interval and a duration..ISO 8601 defines .. This notation starts with a 'P' and uses a 'T' to separate the day and larger units from the hour and smaller units. Observing the location relative to the 'T' is important for interpreting the letter 'M', which is used for both months and minutes..Do datetime values include time zone information.

Perl subroutines can be invoked with a function syntax or a method syntax..How to define a function..How to invoke a function..Parens are mandatory, even for functions which take no arguments. Omitting the parens returns the function or method as an object. Whitespace can occur between the function name and the following left paren..In Python 3 print is a function instead of a keyword; parens are mandatory around the argument..Ruby parens are optional. Leaving out the parens results in ambiguity when function invocations are nested. The interpreter resolves the ambiguity by assigning as many arguments as possible to the innermost function invocation, regardless of its actual arity. It is mandatory that the left paren not be separated from the method name by whitespace..How to apply a function to an array..Perl passes the elements of arrays as individual arguments. In the following invocation, the function . does not know which arguments came from which array.

Lambdas are closures and can refer to local variables in scope, even if they are returned from that scope..If a closure function is needed that contains more than one statement, use a nested function:.Python closures are read only..A nested function can be returned and hence be invoked outside of its containing function, but it is not visible by its name outside of its containing function..The following lambda and Proc object behave identically:.With respect to control words, Proc objects behave like blocks and lambdas like functions. In particular, when the body of a Proc object contains a . or . statement, it acts like a . or . in the code which invoked the Proc object. A . in a lambda merely causes the lambda to exit, and a . inside a lambda must be inside an appropriate control structure contained with the lambda body..Ruby are alternate syntax for defining lambdas and invoking them:.The syntax for invoking an anonymous function..How to store a function in a variable and pass it as an argument..If a variable containing a string is used like a function then PHP will look for a function with the name in the string and attempt to invoke it..Python function are stored in variables by default.

        "Want us to do your project?.100,000+.Hours Worked.300+.Projects accomplished.200+.Clients assisted.Backend development, Application Development.Feb 27, 2020.\r\n            An application is only as good as the backend that supports it. Backend development is here to stay. As all businesses make their way through the internet, it is becoming imperative to have both a mobile app and a website at your disposal, which connects to a common server in the backend..\r\n \r\n            This is the need of the hour. To find and cultivate a workforce that is able to code the backend in a manner that assists in operations and data collection..\r\n\r\n\r\n            Both PHP and Python exist as the most used web development languages in the world. They are the backbone of any start-up or custom web application company that wants to create a splash in the market.    .\n. .\r\n\r\n            Web designing follows a particular hierarchy which traditionally looks like:.\r\n            Development of websites takes place via the usage of a programming language, one that can assist in all three of the above without complicating the work at the same time give leeway to be dynamic. .\r\n\r\n            Dynamic web-application has two facets as mentioned above, client and server-side. The client refers to the device on which the user is viewing your program and the server-side is where the program is running and handling and interpreting the commands being sent by the user..\n.\r\n          Understanding PHP begins with knowing that it came into existence unintentionally. It started as a basic framework that would help a person track views on his CV online. .\r\n\r\n          Initially a personal home page tool, PHP grew exponentially to become a framework that could be used to create entry-level dynamic web applications and then released to the public. .\r\n\r\n          Since PHP was open source it expanded and oh boy did it expand. Two major things were seen during its expansion. .\r\n        This did not slow down PHPs growth and even at this very particular moment over 80% of websites in the market are PHP driven. .\r\n        This isn’t because it is just that amazing but rather because there are a lot of . out there. Since it is an open-source language learning and finding solutions to your issues becomes easier. Finding a PHP developer is literally one of the easiest things you can do.  .\r\n\r\n       But, there is however a flip side to this. In which if by any chance you get stuck with a less than competent designer you are doomed.\r\n        If you take into account how versatile PHP is as a language you will also realize that there are 30 ways to come to the same conclusion but if you don’t know the most efficient ways of getting there you will end up with a code that is very difficult to interpret.\r\n         .\r\n\r\n       Security issues also crop up in the absence of thoroughly checking a chosen library.  .\n.\r\n       Python actually came into existence with the help of using the basic principles of another programming language being developed at the same time i.e. ABC. .\r\n\r\n       Python, however, has emerged to become one of the most elegant, thought through and well-designed language on the block. It stands out with its ability to provide both flexibility as well as high performance. .\r\n\r\n       Unlike how PHP came into existence Python from the get-go had the distinction of being a full-stack programming language. But this was not in association with the web which in turn has led to it not being the most used web programming language. Actually, just about 3% of all websites on the internet use Python. .\n.\r\n        But why is this the case? Why is PHP more popular even though python clearly has a technical advantage over it in almost every aspect. I say almost because the truth is PHP is dominating the marketing. \r\n    .Understanding .\r\n       Since Python is a general programming language, it is just much easier to pick it up. It is considered to be one of the leading languages to be taught to beginners to help them enter the world of programming. Python programs are easy to write as they are short and the syntax is extremely readable.  \r\n      .\r\n     PHP began as something completely different and because of its origins as a web-only language, it has caveats that need to be understood before adopting the language in stand-alone programs. \r\n      .\n.\n.\n.The Community .\r\n       This is an important facet of any programming language, a strong community backing the whole program is great to help you out when you get stuck in problems. Both Python and PHP here are very close. PHP has its community to take primarily for its growth and Python gained notoriety when Google decided to use it for applications like YouTube. Even incredibly popular web applications like Pinterest and Instagram have a python based backend. However, the world's most popular social networking site Facebook uses PHP. \r\n      .\n.\n.Documentation .\r\n       Since both languages have been around for an extensive period of time they are both privy to extensive documentation. Just have a look at their community pages and you will be more or less sorted.  \r\n      .\n.\n.Pricing .\r\n       It definitely helps that they are both open source. Both of them are widely available on the internet without any exceptions. \r\n      .\n.\n.Library Support .\r\n       This is where Python has a slight edge over the rest. Python is extremely nuanced and provides an exceptionally designed library for all its applications. PHP has Packagist which is good but no match to the Python supported libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Theano, etc. What sets python truly apart is its ability to incorporate Machine Learning-Driven Libraries in its web framework.  \r\n      .\n.\n.Debugging .\r\n      Both are again caught in a tie as they are both equipped with some really great debugger tools. PDB is Pythons and PHP has the support of PDB and XDebug. Both the debugging tools provide you with usual features like stacks, breakpoints, path mapping and so on. \r\n      .\n.\n.\r\n        Understanding that both languages have their pros and cons is the first step to understanding that the programming work is evolving. PHP might be widespread at this given point of time in the case of usage on the internet but things are changing. Python is a relatively better programming language. But if you are not comfortable enough while using it, things can get ugly and fast.  .\r\n\r\n        Understand what your project requires and move forward from there.  \r\n\r\n      ",

        "The former second-class citizens of the programming world have leaped to the fore, changing the face of enterprise software development. With the rise of Web 2.0, scripting languages (also called dynamic languages) are now often considered important tools in a developer's arsenal. That's a far cry from than their old reputation as lesser tools for those who can't handle \"real\" programming..Dynamic languages are certainly popular. Almost 70 percent of the 1,200 developers surveyed by Evans Data for its most recent Global Development Survey currently use JavaScript, the most popular dynamic language, with fifteen percent more planning to adopt it. PHP is used by just over a third of developers, and Perl has captured about a quarter of developers (though Perl is much more popular in North America, with 36 percent spending at least some of their time using it)..However, like any other tool, dynamic languages are not necessarily interchangeable. Each has its place in a programmer's toolkit. We asked a group of luminaries in the scripting world for their perspectives on the current state of the scripting universe, and how it has changed since . in 2005..Norris Boyd is the creator and maintainer of Mozilla Rhino, a JavaScript implementation for Java. Boyd was part of the JavaScript team at Netscape. Today, he is an engineering manager at Google..Richard Dice is the president of the ., the organization which has responsibility for Perl's legal, organizational, technical and administrative infrastructure..Jeff Hobbs is director of languages and Tcl tech lead at ActiveState Software and a member of the Tcl core team..Steve Holden is chairman of the ., and author of ...John Lam leads the . team at Microsoft..Rohan Pall, representing PHP, is a consultant who has been programming Web applications for almost a decade..: What place do scripting languages have in today's computing environment? .: The biggest change since 2005 has been the growth of richer Web applications that perform more of their computations in the browser using JavaScript. The demand for these applications has forced developers to learn and use JavaScript much more than before..There's also been a lot of interest in Ruby, another dynamic language, spurred by the release and growth of Ruby on Rails. As a result of these changes, many developers are becoming more comfortable with dynamic languages..: Since 2005, there haven't been any singular events that changed the way scripting languages are used or their capabilities. They have evolved (more in perception than in real capability) from a place where they were used only for simple tasks or prototyping of new systems into much more general use. The general upward slope in their acceptance and capabilities in that time, though, means that CIOs definitely need to put them on their radar and develop \"scripting language awareness.\"  In late 2007, Forrester Research published its . survey, so research on the topic is out there to work with..: Scripting languages are increasingly prevalent in Web applications, with PHP's growing popularity and the rise of Ruby on Rails, while maintaining their dominance in important daily tasks such as machine and test automation with Tcl and data manipulation with Perl. Python is finding increasing use in the scientific communities..: Scripting languages are being used in a wide range of application areas. Python has recently achieved increased visibility in many areas of science and engineering, particularly in .. Three significant Web frameworks (., . and .) have reached maturity in the last three years..Scripting languages have a place anywhere that a systems programming language (e.g., implementing an operating system) is not required. Otherwise they fit basically anywhere, whether it be on the server or the desktop. Python excels in all these areas!.: In general, it's easier to create and change code written in a dynamic language. Much of the Web has traditionally been created using dynamic languages, from Ajax on the client to server code written in PHP, Perl, Python and Ruby. Ruby on Rails in particular has driven a lot of interest towards Ruby, and is one of the preferred platforms to build Web 2.0 startups on..: In the last three years, we've seen the adoption of very fast CPUs, namely the Intel Core 2 line.  Breaking the 3GHz barrier on this architecture—and now pushing 4GHz—has sped up dynamic language code to the point where many algorithms that simply weren't feasible to implement in PHP are now possible on commodity hardware..In the last year, I've participated in writing text analysis software for auto-classifying documents.  Our initial plan was to use C to do the heavy processing and PHP for the rest. As it turned out, on midrange commodity hardware, we were able to use PHP throughout and maintain solid performance.\nWeb applications are commonly scripted, but in my experience, even internal processing-intensive applications are now commonly being implemented in modern, dynamic, scripting programming languages.  The bulwarks have been breached and progress is now ushered in..: What changes are you seeing in attitudes towards scripting (dynamic) languages?.: The increased use of JavaScript for . is sparking interest in JavaScript as a language for use outside the browser. I work on Mozilla Rhino, which is a JavaScript environment for Java, and we have seen a lot of people using Rhino on the server side to add scripting to their applications. It's a nice extension language for applications since it was designed from the start to run inside another application..: I'm noticing changing attitudes from several angles. As I mentioned before, Forrester Research released a Wave survey paper last year regarding dynamic languages.  This was motivated by their noticing that their customers were using more dynamic languages and requesting information on the competitive landscape in the field of dynamic languages.. \nTools companies, including . and ActiveState, are offering more and better products for working with dynamic languages..A segment of Java programmers seem to be embracing Ruby (and Rails) in particular. A new dynamic language, Groovy, is capitalizing on this trend by providing a dynamic language on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that incorporates elements of both Java and Ruby..Support for independent software vendors (ISVs) with dynamic languages is also improving. The .'s recently-released LSB 3.2 spec includes Perl and Python as first-class supported languages within the spec, so ISVs who target this spec for their software can depend on Perl and Python being present in regularized configurations..: The dynamic languages are becoming more accepted. This is in part through more ., which all the dominant dynamic languages are (versus Java and .Net, which are questionably open in their process and/or sources). It is also due to good frameworks being developed using newer languages such as Ruby on Rails. You also see larger organizations fostering support for the languages, such as ., which was made their primary development language for ...: People seem more positive towards scripting languages. They have, over time, come to realize that their performance is such that they work for most problems and have also learned that the compilation step can be heavy-handed and a huge time sink in the development cycle..There is now a more general appreciation of the advantages of dynamic languages, whose characteristics are well-suited to . test-driven development techniques that have also become more popular in the same time frame..The last three years have seen increased uptake in dynamic languages in many application areas. For Python in particular, the . (now a Microsoft open-source project) and . (whose primary developer was recently hired by Sun Microsystems) implementations have had a positive impact..: Compilation is orthogonal to static/dynamic. IronRuby is a compiled language (and an interpreted one too— we offer both options), yet it is clearly a dynamic language. So it's better to say that there are changes in attitude between static versus dynamic languages. .There is a \"polyglot programmer\" meme going around which roughly says that future systems will be built on a statically typed library foundation (e.g. BCL in .Net) with a dynamically typed language used in a dual role to both script those static types as well as define a domain-specific language (DSL) which will be used to implement the high level app logic..: For a large number of applications, when deciding what technology to use, it is no longer the case that the debate centers around dynamic languages versus compiled languages.  Scripting is now considered real programming, and indeed most people don't even use the word \"scripting\" when describing what they do, but instead call it \"programming.\"  These days, it boils down to which dynamic programming language to use, not if you should use one..: What effect has the growing prevalence of Ajax had on the adoption of the various languages? Are people adapting the techniques to languages other than JavaScript?.: Other than a greater comfort with dynamic languages, I don't know of specific impacts of Ajax on other languages. The . are really only applicable inside the browser. .: Ajax is entirely a JavaScript phenomenon—it stands for \"Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.\"  It is not so much a technology itself as a way of combining several existing technologies (CSS, XHTML, XML, DHTML and JavaScript, and the various document object models (DOMs) available within modern Web browsers). Taking these technologies together and calling them Ajax, ., visually appealing and functionally rich than previous Web application development paradigms afforded..The first scripting language to benefit from Ajax in a big way was Ruby, though this was much more an accident than anything else. A Ruby Web rapid application development framework called Ruby on Rails started gaining attention in 2005. It had three things in its favor: it was based on the Ruby language (which a lot of people find quite nice to program with), developers found it to be a significant boost to productivity, and it was the first framework to integrate with any Ajax library. So it quickly became identified with Ajax and vice versa. Nowadays, every major scripting language has decent integration with every major Ajax library..Most Ajax usage in Web applications development involves interaction with the server-side of the Web application. The front end of the application—the end that lives on the Web browser—is HTML, Javascript, Ajax, etc. The front end interacts with (and most often is dynamically created by) the back-end, which can be programmed in Perl, Python, Ruby (or Java, C++, Smalltalk, Lisp, etc.)..: JavaScript is just the front-end language, often with a dynamic language on the back-end. These are commonly Python, PHP or Ruby (Rails), as they have become popular through common Web frameworks. Dynamic languages are common because they are much easier to use than Java or .Net on the background, providing as much as 10x more developer productivity. You can always throw more hardware at a problem, but . is key, and dynamic languages provide great leverage to succeed..: Since Ajax is simply asynchronous network calls, it is not affecting the adoption of any specific language beyond more JavaScript usage in webpages. The technique of Ajax is in no way new and has been available for decades, including in Python..In the Python world, the TurboGears framework in particular accommodates support for several well-known Ajax toolkits, but . is essentially orthogonal to the language used for Web development, and is as likely to be used in the ASP.Net environment as by Python users..: Ajax is popular because browsers are popular. JavaScript's popularity is directly tied to the fact that it's deployed on virtually all browsers today. Right now, there really aren't any other dynamic languages for the browser that are widely deployed, so nobody's really trying. \nI coined the term ARAX to try and drive some thinking around using Ruby in the browser as an alternative language to JavaScript. That generated some interest in the Rails community since they would be interested in running some of their Ruby code in the browser..: Ajax is a very specific technology that allows webpages to rise above mediocre user-interfaces and become true applications using JavaScript. Flash ActionScript has had this capability for a while, but now lightweight solutions are possible without depending on proprietary tools like Flash that are sometimes not available for use in large internal projects or secure sites.",

        "I wish to go into coding, but i see so many different languages that i wonder which one would be actually useful to learn?.Many say to always start with HTLM & CSS as a beginner, but why can`t i start with PHP or Javascript right away>.You can start learning PHP and Javascript first if that is your preference..However, it is beneficial to have a good understanding of HTML and CSS before learning the others..In terms of the first aspect of your question Python is meant to be an extremely useful language to learn, hence that is what I am learning..This depends on what you're trying to accomplish.  If you're building websites, I'd make sure you know HTML, CSS, Javascript, and then maybe PHP. If you're writing applications, maybe Java or Python or C#.  Then there is SQL in its many flavors because what doesn't store data?  Of course if you're writing some kind of interface to hardware like drivers, C++ and even assembly code may be the best answer..It's kind of like saying you want to get into building or repairing things, and want to know if which is more useful: a set of wrenches, a socket set, or some nut drivers.  All of them do kind of the same thing, but you must pick the one that let's you do the job the fastest and easiest way possible in a given circumstance.  There isn't a blanket right answer.   .Of  course, one answer for both tools and programming languages is typically \"get as many as you can\", then select which one is a best fit depending on the particular circumstances..Javascript, Java, and C# are all very similar in syntax.  Python is said to be the most widely used, but is difficult to debug since it relies on indentation for program structure.  In professional development shops, it's mostly Java and C# depending on Linux/Windows, so I'd think you can have the broadest possible utility out of understanding the syntax of Java and Javascript over Python and PHP, but PHP is still a highly used language for web development, particularly in Linux platforms..This is an opinion based answer but JavaScript can be used universally. If you are trying to learn a language that will be used many different platforms, HTML, PHP and Python I would go with JavaScript. Hope this helps..If you want to learn web/ app development; I suggest starting off with HTML & CSS and then going moving to JS & PHP. I have a couple of friends who are taking intro to computer science courses and their course starts them off with JS. Well I have had to help them out numerous times because they don't know how the document interacts with HTML & CSS. What elements, ID's, and classes are. They didn't know how to import a JS file into an HTML document until I showed them. So in my opinion any time you are learning / studying start with the foundation and in the listed languages here is HTML & CSS..After that:.Javascript - Allows end users to interact with the DOM (document). Back in the day it could not do any server processing but now with NODE.js you can execute things with the server. I believe it requires a good amount of HTML & CSS to use JS appropriately. Don't forget that there are end users that turn off JS on their phones / browsers. Also JAVA by Oracle is not Javascript. Using AJAX can dynamically call server functions which is neat..PHP - Is a beautiful mess. I am currently learning OctoberCMS which uses the Laravel framework and it has been a pleasure. PHP executes in the server before the page is rendered. It interacts with a database (mysql,mariadb,etc) and pulls records using queries. Interactive websites allows users to update those records in the database like profile information, forums, blogs etc. This can do mathematical operations (JS can to but I don't use it for that). There are PHP template engines as well like TWIG..Python - I have not used Python for app development because most hosting only allow you to work with HTML, PHP, NODE.JS with additonal Costs. But I have made a python scripts for blender and photoshop to do fun efficient things for me. Its cool..C++ - I have only stared at it. I have not needed to learn at it. It is a computer application language though not a web development code..    .\n        This topic has been locked by an administrator and is no longer open for commenting.\n      .\n        To continue this discussion, please\n        ..\n      ",

        "Share.Today, the Elasticsearch developer team is excited to announce the release of official Elasticsearch clients for Ruby, Python, PHP and Perl, with other languages to follow in the future. All of the clients are licensed under the Apache 2 open source license..The Elasticsearch community has done a great job over the years of providing clients for many languages. The feature set of these clients varies greatly: some are low level thin wrappers, some are high level with many abstractions. Some focus on the Elasticsearch API, while others focus on the networking layer. Some have extensive coverage of the Elasticsearch APIs and some just implement the few APIs that the developer needs..And they are all implemented in the preferred style of the developer..A number of our users have multiple languages in their codebase and want to use Elasticsearch from all of them. Differences between clients can make this more complicated than it need be..We have written these clients with the following goals in mind:.It should be as simple as possible to go from the . directly to the client of your choice. All of the Elasticsearch APIs provided by these clients are direct translations of the native Elasticsearch REST interface.  There should be no guessing required..While it is easy to make HTTP calls to Elasticsearch, handling dynamic node detection or failover when nodes disappear is tricky.  These clients provide a solid networking base for playing nicely with the cluster..We have implemented the full REST interface.  Nothing is missing. And the method calls and parameters are consistent between languages: you can make the same calls from any of the supported clients.  That said, each client still feels like it belongs to the language it is written in.  It won’t feel like you are programming Java in Ruby, or C++ in PHP.  .These clients are not tied to a particular networking module.  Different HTTP backends can be plugged in for different environments, or to match the HTTP client that you are already using. But this abstraction also allows us to plugin different transport protocols in the future, which are more efficient than HTTP..The API that these clients provide is a thin wrapper around the REST interface.  Perhaps their style is different from your own, and you’d prefer more abstractions.  We hear you, so we have built these clients to be extensible.  We have tried to do the hard stuff for you, to provide you with a solid foundation for building your own interface.This is the beauty of open source: our users will have great ideas that haven’t even occurred to us.  Now you also have the tools to implement them, without having to start from scratch..Because we wrote these clients and they are tested by us, we can provide official support for them.  When bugs are found, we can fix them quickly – it’s our job. .Each client is available from GitHub and also from the standard distribution network for each language, where one exists.. This is the first release of these clients. Please download them, try them out and give us feedback.  What doesn’t work? What is missing? What can we do better?. . .My name is Clinton Gormley and I’ve been using Perl since 1999 and Elasticsearch from the first release back in early 2010.  At the time I was working for the largest obituary and family announcement website in Europe and we desperately needed a solution for full text search. .I kept putting it off because the options that existed back then made me want to cry. But eventually, I couldn’t put it off any longer.  Before starting, I searched Google again, just in case a different solution had become available, and discovered an interview with Shay Banon discussing version 0.4 of Elasticsearch. I clicked through to the website and it looked too good to be true: simple, scalable, easy to start using.  I tried it out and found that it lived up to its promises!.The first thing that I needed was a Perl API so I wrote . and have been maintaining it ever since.  ElasticSearch.pm is used by . amongst others..The new . client is a complete rewrite of the original codebase with a number of improvements, especially in extensibility, logging and handling node failover, that would have been difficult to add in the old version. I apologise in advance for the change in naming: ElasticSearch to Elasticsearch….Currently there is only support for using . as a backend, but I will soon be releasing backends for HTTP::Lite, LWP, libcurl and AnyEvent too.  Also, I will release an ElasticSearch::Compat module which will make it easy to migrate your existing code to the new Elasticsearch client..In the meantime, please try out the new client and let me know of anything that is missing via the GitHub issues list.. . .Add `elasticsearch/elasticsearch` to your `composer.json`:.Then install with composer.My name is Zachary Tong and I’ve been working in PHP off and on for about 12 years.  I had the pleasure of meeting Elasticsearch about two years ago around release 0.18.6.1.  We’ve been in a steady relationship ever since..At the time I was working as a molecular biologist and was desperately dissatisfied with available biomedical search engines.  Always being an evening-hacker at heart, I obtained a lease to the NLM Medline database of biomedical abstracts and began trying to develop a better search solution.  Wouldn’t you know it…search is a Hard Problem!.I stumbled onto Elasticsearch at that point and was excited by the combination of features + performance (even on my modest laptop).  Although that particular search project never left my laptop, I’ve continued using Elasticsearch for a variety of personal and professional projects since..Coming from a non-information-retrieval background (and largely non-computer-science background), many of the concepts in Elasticsearch were foreign to me.  Shards, indexes, TF-IDF, analyzers, ngrams, what?  It can be overwhelming for newcomers to the search field.  I find that I learn best by teaching, so over the last two years I’ve written a number of articles on my personal blog..Although I’ve been coding and writing about Elasticsearch for a long time, I have never really participated in the open source community until recently.  My first big forray into OSS was with a PHP client for Elasticsearch.  This caught the attention of developers at Elasticsearch and the rest is history..I’m very excited about the clients being released today.  My hope is to free developers from the drudgery of “boring” low-level interaction with an Elasticsearch cluster.  Using this client as a base we can start to build more interesting components, like bundles for popular frameworks, or advanced ORMs that abstract away the cluster entirely.. . .My name is Honza Král, I chose Python as my primary language in 2006 and haven’t looked back. Before I joined Elasticsearch in April of 2013 my job was to develop and maintain backends for a few bigger content websites based on the . web framework. Before that I spent my days as an ETL guy working in data warehousing.I learned about Elasticsearch as part of my job when I was looking for a search engine to power our full-text search and was immediately captured by it’s balance of ease-of-use and powerful feature set. It reminded me of my days as a data guy and dove right in..Ever since the beginning of my programming career I was drawn towards open-source and, whenever possible, would contribute back to the project I am using. It was no surprise then that once I learned that there is an opening for a Python guy on the team to work on the new client I couldn’t let it pass by..Since the new clients we’re releasing today are a very close mapping to the REST API it should be very easy for any elasticsearch user to learn and use, as well as flexible enough for any possible use-case. This should enable us to work well with existing clients and provide a clean migration path for people who would wish to migrate – we will try and work with the maintainers of existing clients to port their code to be a layer on top of this new client, thus enabling developers to keep their code while getting the benefit of using our new client underneath.. . .My name is Karel Minařík, and I discovered Elasticsearch in late 2010, when I was researching alternatives for CouchDB-Lucene, which I was using on a project at the time. As I’m quite often quoted, I initially considered the project a hoax; there just can’t exist such a magical project with so many buzzwords (HTTP, JSON, schema-free, distributed, …), I was saying to myself. Nevertheless, I installed the project, glanced on the source, and it not only did what it said on the tin — it surpassed all expectations, up to the level where my colleagues didn’t believed me when I was demoing it..Our application was written in Ruby, and we had a pretty good idea how we would like to “talk” to Elasticsearch: we need a DSL for its DSL! One late evening, I have . such Ruby DSL, and after some time, we had a brand new client as a Rubygem, called . and later renamed to .. Little did I know that . will get nearly 1,500 watchers and 500 forks at Github, that I’ll solve more then 700 issues, and the library will grow to be loved and hated by many users.. managed to solve many issues for a nice Ruby and Rails integration, and it also managed to make some seriously bad decisions. Today marks a fresh start for me, and for Ruby users of Elasticsearch. Today, we’re releasing a suite of clients with common design and semantics, which aims to provide a solid foundation for further extensions, integrations and experiments..If you liked ., you can be sure that all the convenience for painless Rails integration will come soon. If you hated ., I’d like to invite you to kick the tires on the new Ruby client. I took great care to avoid all the bad decisions of Tire, and make the library — or, in fact a collection of three libraries — as modular, extensible and robust as much as I could. Your feedback, opinions and critique — either via Github issues, via IRC or via e-mail — is most welcome!.Work for a global, distributed team where finding someone like you is just a Zoom meeting away.
