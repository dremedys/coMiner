Tiobe is . that some developers believe should be used to make this important decision for employability.   . .Python is considered a more general language than R, . purpose-built for large datasets and statistical analysis, yet multiple language indexes have detected a decline in R's popularity, despite the growth of machine learning.   .\"The main reason why Python is preferred to R is because Python is a real generic programming language with a very large user community,\" Tiobe's CEO Paul Jensen told ZDNet.  .\"Almost every professional software engineer has some knowledge in Python but not in R. So if you want to do some serious stuff in the statistical domain professional software engineers will use Python. R is limited to field experts in the domain of statistical engineering and that is a more restricted set of people.\" .IEEE Spectrum's index last year . that R peaked at fifth position in 2016, fell to sixth spot in 2017, and then fell again to seventh in 2018.   .The engineering magazine speculated that Python's ascent and R's decline could be down to the growth in high-quality Python libraries for statistics and machine learning, in turn making it a more attractive starting point than specialized R.   .As Netflix engineers ., Python adoption among developers has been spurred by a growing ecosystem of handy software libraries like NumPy and SciPy, which it uses to perform numerical analysis for its failover services.   .The video-streaming giant uses Python for everything that delivers content to users, from managing devices in its content distribution network to recommendations and building security tools.   .Developer analyst Redmonk also noted a two-spot fall in R's ranking last August but the company cautioned not to place too much importance on this move since R had dropped two spots previously and bounced back after that.   .R's specificity would keep it outside the top 10 languages, but also keep it relevant in the field it was built for, ..   .Tiobe analysts contend that R's decline in its index signals a consolidation of the market for statistical programming languages, and the winner of this shift is Python.   .\"After having been in the top 20 for about three years, statistical language R dropped out this month. This is quite surprising because the field of statistical programming is still booming, especially thanks to the popularity of data mining and artificial intelligence,\" ..   .\"It seems that there is a consolidation going on in the statistical programming market. Python has become the big winner. A possible reason for this is that statistical programming is finding its way from university to industry nowadays and Python is more accepted by the industry.\"   .The company's rankings are based on search-engine results related to programming language queries. While it is considered by some developers as a useful gauge to what languages to learn, . are suspicious of the results produced by its search-engine based methodology.    .Nonetheless, as a general rule, Tiobe's top 10 isn't wide of the mark compared with other indexes, like IEEE Spectrum or PYPL. The current top 10 in Tiobe's index in descending order are Java, C, C++, Python, VB .NET, C#, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and Assembly Language.   .Tiobe reckons R's disappearance from its top 20 signals a consolidation in statistical programming languages, and the winner of that shift is Python..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.Please review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription..\n            You agree to receive updates, promotions, and alerts from ZDNet.com.

Entrepreneur, mentor and startup advisor.\n        .Beginners in Data Science often have the question of which programming language to choose as the main one - a specific one created specifically for data processing - R, or the universal Python, which is popular in other areas as well. Tech business owners and startups also have questions like when Python or R is the right choice for Data Science, what specialist will be more useful for the data science team, or ... .Both languages (Python and R) are supported by open-source licenses (as opposed to commercial SAS and SPSS tools or proprietary MATLAB) and traditionally are considered the most popular. The rapid development of Data Science leads to a quick change of positions of these two programming languages. In this article, we will analyze the trends in the confrontation Python vs R for data science, the advantages, and disadvantages of these two programming languages and is it possible to combine them in 2020.. .The design of any programming language implies a compromise. Low-level programming languages are difficult to learn, require a programmer to do a lot of manual work, but allow flexible code optimization and performance. High-level languages allow programmers to solve the same tasks more conveniently and simply but have fewer methods and tools for optimization. One of these programming languages is Python.. .Since its release in 1991, the Python programming language has been extremely popular and widely used in data processing. Here are some reasons for its popularity:.However, unlike R, Python does not have specialized packages for statistical computations. The main audience of Python is software developers and web developers. Most of the functional modules were created especially for them, which allow . to download data, perform complex operations with them, model, and analyze. .R is a programming language for statistical data processing and graphics work, as well as a free open-source computing environment within the GNU Project. The language was created as a similar language to S, developed in Bell Labs, and is its alternative implementation, although there are significant differences between the languages, most of its code in the S language runs in the R environment. . .It is widely used as a statistical software for data analysis and has actually become a standard for statistical programs.. .The language and environment are available under the GNU GPL license. R uses a command-line interface, although several graphical user interfaces are available, such as the R Commander package, RKWard, RStudio, Weka, Rapid Miner, KNIME, as well as tools for integration into office packages.. .In 2010, R was named one of the winners of Infoworld Magazine's Open Application Development Software category.. .The first release of R programming for data science took place in 1995, and since then it has become one of the most frequently used tools for data science..In terms of performance, R programming for data science is not the fastest and can sometimes eat a lot of memory when working with large data sets..Let's consider the advantages and disadvantages of Python and R, noted by the data analysts who use them. Both programming languages have pros and cons, some of them are noticeable, some can be easily ignored. .Like any programming language, R has some disadvantages. Each programmer decides on their own what disadvantage can not be ignored and what should not be noticed. .Python is a widely-used programming language. A lot of programmers like it for its simpleness. If it is simple, it does not mean it has low functionality. .Despite Python being an object-oriented programming language, it has some disadvantages for Data Science. Maybe they are not crucial, but each programmer or data science team before they start work on a Data Science project, decide on their own..The battle continues Python vs R for Data Analysis. There are people in the Data Science community who use Python and R, but the percentage is small. On the other hand, it is often the case that adherents of only one programming language would like to use some features of the other language.. .For example, R users sometimes crave object-oriented features built into the Python language. Similarly, some Python users dream about the wide range of statistical distributions available in the R language.. .Right now, there is a growing number of . who know both languages and use one or the other as needed. The question arises - is it possible to combine the advantages of languages in one application? For example, it would seem logical to be able to call the R library from Python, and for statisticians familiar with Python, to run programs in Python directly from R. Both languages can perform these operations using third-party libraries:.Such solutions allow not to switch from one system to another and create programs from ready-made solutions within one application, using modern Python modules and previously implemented specific packages from R.. .Both R and Python are reliable languages, and one of them is actually enough for the task of data analysis. However, they have their pros and cons, and if you use the strengths of each, a data science team can do a much better project. Anyway, knowing both gives more flexibility and increases chances to work in different environments..Both languages appeared in the ‘90s, and have already managed to build up powerful ecosystems of users. As an example, both communities have many active members on Stack Overflow (Python, R). In the beginning, R was used only in the academic environment, but as interest in Data Science grew, it came to commercial applications as well. However, in recent years, Python has acquired a lot of tools for data analysis and managed to provide the necessary competition. The ability to use Python to quickly embed data analysis into web applications makes Python even very useful.. .The programmer you choose depends on the tasks you're going to accomplish and the time you're willing to devote to development. If you plan to create a great project in data science, we recommend a programmer who knows both languages. A person with knowledge of R concepts and libraries will be one step ahead of people working only with Python. A person that is familiar with R will be especially useful if your data science team wants to use not only ready-made algorithms in Python libraries, but also apply all the intellectual power accumulated by statisticians.. .Still not sure what programmer do you need?

When values are returned from Python to R they are converted back to R types. Types are converted as follows:.If a Python object of a custom class is returned then an R reference to that object is returned. You can call methods and access properties of the object just as if it was an instance of an R reference class..The . function can be used to import any Python module. For example:.The . and . functions give you access to the main module where code is executed by default and the collection of built in Python functions. For example:.The main module is generally useful if you have executed Python code from a file or string and want to get access to its results (see the section below for more details)..The . function will source a Python script and make the objects it creates available within an R environment (by default the calling environment). For example, consider the following Python script:.We source it using the . function and then can call the . function directly from R:.You can execute Python code within the main module using the . and . functions. You can then access any objects created using the . object exported by reticulate:.By default when Python objects are returned to R they are converted to their equivalent R types. However, if you’d rather make conversion from Python to R explicit and deal in native Python objects by default you can pass . to the . function. In this case Python to R conversion will be disabled for the module returned from .. For example:.As illustrated above, if you need access to an R object at end of your computations you can call the . function explicitly..You can print documentation on any Python object using the . function. For example:.The automatic conversion of R types to Python types works well in most cases, but occasionally you will need to be more explicit on the R side to provide Python the type it expects..For example, if a Python API requires a list and you pass a single element R vector it will be converted to a Python scalar. To overcome this simply use the R . function explicitly:.Similarly, a Python API might require a . rather than a list. In that case you can use the . function:.R named lists are converted to Python dictionaries however you can also explicitly create a Python dictionary using the . function:.This might be useful if you need to pass a dictionary that uses a more complex object (as opposed to a string) as its key..R and Python have different default numeric types. If you write . in R it is considered a floating point number whereas . in Python is considered an integer..This means that when a Python API expects an integer, you need to be sure to use the . suffix within R. For example, if the . function requires an integer as its . argument you would do this:.Python collections are addressed using 0-based indices rather than the 1-based indices you might be familiar with from R. So to address the first item of an array in R you would write:.Whereas if you are calling a method in Python via reticulate that takes an index you would write this to address the first item:.Note the use of the 0-based index as well as the . to indicate t that the value is an integer..R matrices and arrays are converted automatically to and from . arrays..When converting from R to NumPy, the NumPy array is mapped directly to the underlying memory of the R array (no copy is made). In this case, the NumPy array uses a column-based in memory layout that is compatible with R (i.e. Fortran style rather than C style). When converting from NumPy to R, R receives a column-ordered copy of the NumPy array..You can also manually convert R arrays to NumPy using the . function. For example, you might do this if you needed to create a NumPy array with C rather than Fortran style in-memory layout (for higher performance in row-oriented computations) or if you wanted to control the data type of the NumPy array more explicitly. Here are some example uses of .:.Reasoning about arrays which use distinct in-memory orders can be tricky. The . article provides additional details..Also, always remember that when calling NumPy methods array indices are 0 rather than 1 based and require the . suffix to indicate they are integers..R data frames can be automatically converted to and from . DataFrames. By default, columns are converted using the same rules governing R array <-> NumPy array conversion, but a couple extensions are provided:.If the R data frame has row names, the generated Pandas DataFrame will be re-indexed using those row names (and vice versa). Special handling is also available for a . associated with a Pandas DataFrame; however, because R only supports character vectors for row names they are converted to character first..Sparse matrices created by . can be converted ., and vice versa. This is often useful when you want to pass sparse matrices to Python functions that accepts Scipy CSC matrix to take advantage of this format, such as efficient column slicing and fast matrix vector products..For example, we first create a sparse matrix using .:.The sparse matrix looks like this:.Let’s convert it to Scipy CSC matrix using .:.Note that the right-hand side contains the non-zero entries of the matrix while the left-hand side represents their locations in the matrix..We can also use . to convert the CSC matrix back to . representation that can then be manipulated easily in R which is the same as the original sparse matrix that we created earlier using .:.The R . generic function can be used to interact with Python context manager objects (in Python you use the . keyword to do the same). For example:.This example opens a file and ensures that it is automatically closed at the end of the with block. Note the use of the . operator to alias the object created by the context manager..If a Python API returns an iterator or a generator, you can interact with it using the . function. The . function can be used to apply an R function to each item yielded by the iterator:.If you don’t pass a function to . the results will be collected into an R vector:.Note that the . will be drained of their values by .:.You can also iterate on an element-by-element basis using the . function. For example:.By default . will return . when the iteration is complete but you can provide a custom . value it will be returned instead. For example:.Note that some iterators/generators in Python are infinite. In that case the caller will need custom logic to determine when to terminate the loop..Python . are functions that implement the Python iterator protocol. Similarly, the reticulate . function enables you to create a Python iterator from an R function..In Python, generators produce values using the . keyword. In R, values are simply returned from the function. One benefit of the . keyword is that it enables successive iterations to use the state of previous iterations. In R, this can be done by returning a function that mutates its enclosing environment via the <<- operator. For example:.If you want to indicate the end of the iteration, return . from the function:.Note that you can change the value that indicates the end of the iteration using the . parameter (e.g. .)..By default R functions are converted to Python with a generic signature (.), where there’s neither keyword argument nor default values for arguments..For example, below we apply . to an R function and then we use . to get the converted function’s argument spec. You can see that the signature of the wrapped function looks different than the original R function’s signature..This default conversion typically works fine, however some Python libraries have strict checking on the function signatures of user provided callbacks. In these cases the generic . signature will fail this checking..For these cases you can use . to wrap the R function so that the wrapped function has exactly the same signature as that of the original R function, e.g. one argument . without default value and another argument . with default value 1.5..Note that the signature of the R function must not contain esoteric Python-incompatible constructs. For example, we cannot have R function with signature like . since Python function requires that arguments without default values appear before arguments with default values..In some cases Python libraries will invoke callbacks on a Python background thread. Since R code must run on the main thread, this won’t work by default when you pass an R function as a callback..To work around this, you can use ., which will provide a special wrapper for your R function that ensures it will only be called on the main thread..There are several more advanced functions available that are useful principally when creating high level R interfaces for Python libraries..Typically interacting with Python objects from R involves using the . operator to access whatever properties for functions of the object you need. When using the ., Python objects are automatically converted to their R equivalents when possible. The following functions enable you to interact with Python objects at a lower level (e.g. no conversion to R is done unless you explicitly call the . function):.You can save and load Python objects (via pickle) using the . and . functions:.The following functions enable you to query for information about the Python configuration available on the current system..These functions enable you to capture or suppress output from Python:.The functions provide miscellaneous other lower-level capabilities:.The following articles cover additional aspects of using .:",

        "(1) Which do you use more in your work?.(2) Which do you prefer?.(3) What would make you switch the language you are using ?.(4) Which one has more appeal/style?.R is used more for academia and academic statistical modeling. It also makes REALLY PRETTY GRAPHS. The ability for R to work as a general programming language had been bolstered in the past few years by the addition of packages that allow it to interact with a variety of computer applications - from web browsers to MS office products..Python is a general purpose language which has some problems with the integrity of advanced statistical packages (unverified authors and code). However, it is easy to learn and great at handling / manipulating large data sets. It's also very useful for almost every taskyou can think of on your computer, so it really is widely applicable..The advice that I have seen is: Learn R, Python, and Bash. Pick either to start with. Go into SQL, Java, and C+ if you want to get really into programming..Python was made by computer scientists and R by statisticians, and it shows. It's simply better as a programming language..With python, you can write elegant code, have better IDEs, better debuggers, better error messages and better exception management. The syntax is much better (<-, <<-, -> and ->>, wtf?) and more regular (in ., y and x are not variables!). Standard classes like dict and are far superior. Python libraries all work alike, but every R coder makes \"different-feeling\" code..If you need more than scripting, Python has it for sure: You can use powerful web frameworks and deep learning tools and many other things. Python is also faster and tools exist to make faster still if you need that (numba)..But many statistics/bioinformatics packages only exist in R, so there's that..note that you can use = instead of <- or ->.Python was made by computer scientists and R by statisticians, and it shows..Yep 100% agree. Python is better for infrastructure building and optimizing workflows, whereas R is far superior for everything a data scientist/researcher will do on a day to day basis. Especially once you implement things like the tidyverse into your workflow, R is just easier to learn for those without a programming background and the code is certainly more elegant for the non programmers. Sure pythons code can be more elegant if you have a deep understanding of all the nuances of computer science and maybe started with other languages, but most bioinformaticians don’t and certainly most of your collaborators in bioinformatics don’t, which is why I see R as far superior..But I’m in academia without a computer science background, so I have my own biases. At the end of the day I allowed both to compete for my attention and I found R better for pretty much everything I do - data management, more intuitive, easier to teach to undergrads in my lab, plot development..lm(y~x) and stuff like that is one of the most powerful things about R. If you look at metaprogramming and non standard evaluation you will see how it works. Its looking for those variables in the environment of the data frame and constructing the design matrix, then applying lm.fit(). The whole tidyverse works this way too with dplyr/tidyr which are far better than what Python has..If you have heard of Julia, it also the formula syntax in GLM and it can look for variables in a dataframe if a macro is used. Its just more explicit there. This stuff is what makes these things very user friendly..I think if you don’t overthink the CS, R‘s quirks won’t get to you. And yea you can always use “=“ I never use the assignment operator except in the console sometimes.RStudio is a great IDE and Python doesn’t have a standard one..You do realize that the \"<-\" syntax comes from the APL keyboard, correct? You can make the claim that it's less readable than \"=\" if you want (although \"=\" also works in R), but it has nothing to do with R & S coming from the statistical world..R and python..R is better for quick bioinformatics analyses due to the large number of specialized packages and the amazingness which is the tidyverse. I end up using it 60% if the time -- but it doesn't do everything well..Python is better for building applications, web development, and machine learning. Also snakemake is amazing! I use python 30% of the time..The last 10% is a mix of Bash and JavaScript..So you really don't need to pick -- learning both is an excellent way to become an efficient bioinformatician. Also, you can use both languages in Rstudio, PyCharm, and Jupyter Notebook..I use R more, and with a past in C/C++/java/maple/matlab it's the worse programming/scripting language I've ever seen. I like python more, it's at least a well designed language. I switched languages multiple times because of switching communities: mathematicians like maple, engineers matlab... and in RNAseq and stats, the tools and the community are in R, so not really a choice. I guess I might have to change again if I change field again. Shiny apps (easy web interfacing), good looking graphs (almost straight into papers), and names on array indices by default are the good parts of R though. Python code more elegant than R, but python library management and programming environment are a pain compared to R, so higher entry barrier imo. If you already know what specific subfield you wanna get into, you will save a lot of headaches by adopting the tool that people in that field are using. If you have no idea where you're going, safe bet is to learn python I think, quite broad applicability. If you wanna do actual algorithmic programming on the computation heavy parts rather than scripting, probably better go for a fast running compiled language like C/C++ or one of the newer analogues..R..Python..Company won't support Python because their academics live in 1995..Julia..Python.Python.It was always python!.Depends on what you want to do! For the most part, anything you can do in R you can do in python,(this applies to statistical analysis and making plots).   R is more user friendly for stats and plots, Matplotlib might be frustrating for a beginner (it was for me). I'm biased and, but I'd say generally learning Python is still the way to go because it has more flexibility outside of the basics - if you want to get into web development, machine learning, or even a more traditional language down the line Python will prepare you better (it's object oriented). From a skills-on-resume perspective I think Python is more appealing..For the most part, anything you can do in R you can do in python,.Is there a python equivalent of bioconductor? Can I load a python module that has all the functions I need for, say, RNA-Seq, written by the leaders of the field?.Stuff like mixed models can mainly be done in R (statsmodels is a huge mess of an API and only supports certain ones). ML can be done in R as well and is probably better in the sense of more statistically accurate (eg tree based models taking cat variables as is, although ive heard h2o can do that but not sklearn). For DL Python is better yea since the R keras/tf call it anyways..XGboost is easier to install in R than Python especially on Macs.I use both. I prefer Python for graphs, stats, ML, etc, but there are some packages that only exist/work well in R so now and again I do use it. I’d say worth doing a course in R and the self-learning Python. Bash also important!!!.i am using both interchangeably.i don't have a strong preference for either. A lot of statistics is easier done in R than in Python. R is also quite popular with academia people, so there is a ton of new packages coming out. Python as a computer language makes more sense to me from the operational perspective, since my background is more of a SWE than that of a statistician..I am testing a mixed workflow of R + Python using reticulate. Let's see how it goes..it doesn't matter.Both are damn usefull, and you pretty much don't need anything else..R for exploratory data analysis, making pretty plots easily and data that fits neatly into matrixes. Python for anything with complex structures / relationions (try storing and parsing a family tree in R!), heavy-duty machine learning or stuff that has to be automated. For the most part, Python is a good substitute for advanced bash-scripts too..They go really well together,  and both should be in your toolbox..I currently use software thats actually a mix of python and R. It works perfectly fine. Easy code AND pretty graphs! ;).1.)  Used to be 100% python but now it is 90% R ,9% bash and 1% python.2.) Python , unless R is more convenient.3.) I change when it makes my job easier or my boss tell me so.4.)  Whichever help me get the job done ( If CFortran is the answer, then Fortran it is ).Python is faster, neater and has more general use. However, the power of R is it’s community, if you are working in a research environment there are lots of phenomenal R packages that do some really niche things and will save you a huge amount of time and effort. Knowing both is the way, also ggplot2 is the best and I will fight anyone who suggests another plotting package..Python all day long..You can do just about anything in Python these days with the correct packages and it is just so much more intuitive and logical. Using R feels like speaking in reverse..IMHO, you should know both (and other languages) and use the right one for each task.Members.Online",

        "In recent years, leaders in the pharmaceutical industry have relied on data science to guide their decision making around vital drug development objectives. Data science experts have multiple layers of responsibilities that include exploring and evaluating data; model development and validation; examining research patterns and generating data insights. And, after all of that, they have to effectively communicate the results in a meaningful way that impacts decisions. Requiring key expertise, functional service providers (FSPs) can play a critical role in guiding and advancing these responsibilities.  .In clinical research, sponsors and some service partners typically use legacy systems like SAS to analyze data, input results and generate insights from it. It’s a conventional method to data analysis. However, being a paid software, SAS does not allow for open-source algorithms. In the last decade, it has gradually become apparent to industry stakeholders that taking advantage of historical data has benefits worthy of consideration for sponsors.  .In aiming to best leverage data insights and ensure enhanced decision making and cost-effective process improvements, it is critical to know what tools experts in statistics, analytics and visualization may find critical for success, which a functional service provider (FSP) manager can help identify per the project needs. Statisticians have been migrating to is open source R and Python programming languages as a supplement to SAS software. .R and Python are gaining relevance as part of the drug discovery and development process. As open-source programming environments with a robust and committed online communities, R and Python have become a powerful set of tools for statisticians and are used extensively within drug development—from molecule to market. .By integrating the data and applying useful algorithms, sponsors can benefit from the extensive data insights needed to make clinical trials more agile and adaptable, ultimately increasing productivity and efficiency to improve success rates. It is important to heighten these efficiencies using the sophisticated tech-enabled solutions and best in analytics platforms to tweak, analyze and leverage large amount of data.  .Depending on the individual project needs, experienced FSP statisticians will ask the question, “What is best to use—R or Python?”.In data science, both R and Python are freely available and popular open source programming languages. But, there are key differences that those working in data analysis should consider. In a nutshell, Python can be considered superior as a programming tool for text analytics and mining of big data. Consider, for example, actigraphy data collection: This can easily generate huge volumes of data that need to be processed, particularly if one is using a functional statistics approach to the analysis. On the other hand, R provides more value for statistical analysis and visual data mining needs. .Integrating FSP experts who hold the right experience and technical training to know these programming languages well and understand how to maximize the benefits of each is extremely useful when working to secure key data points that will guide the decision-making process for sponsors and study teams.    .Statisticians will need to be able to determine which language to use based on the problem under study or key objectives of the analysis at hand. For example, if one is needing statistical analysis rather than text analysis, R programming language is ideal. Alternatively, if one needs to develop a web application or prefers to use general purpose programming language, Python is the preferred choice, given it supports varying data formats. Though for web development one might also want to consider Shiny apps, which allow for a quick and easy statistical application delivered via the browser. The table below (fig1) outlines a simplified set of criteria a biostatistician could use to determine which software fits the problem at hand. .Fig.1 outlines a comparison of known features / benefits between each solution based of Prasanth’s own experience.. Generally, Python is the best fit to grab information from the web and is also good in handling unstructured data libraries that includes popular tools like scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, which eventually enable data scientists to develop sophisticated data models that plug directly into a production system. However, this does not necessarily mean R programming language cannot perform these tasks..With the growing R community and augmenting free libraries and packages available in the CRAN (e.g., e1071, , CARET, H20 etc.), R is now better equipped to handle problems that stem from AI/ML and deep learning. Furthermore, R language is extensively used for the development of prototypes, especially after the introduction of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as R Studio, which has helped data experts create programs that are easier to navigate and use. .Additionally, similar to Python, R also has capabilities for reproducible research and reporting system in the form of R Markdown and Knitr..Overall, experienced statisticians will usually have a preference for one tool over another depending on their current role and project needs. Staying focused on sponsors’ overall goals, FSP experts in this field are key contributors to making sure strategies remain agile and ready to make somewhat complex tasks easier and less time consuming to drive more quality outcomes, while shortening timelines and reducing costs for sponsors. .For questions, training or to learn more about outsourcing biostatistical projects using R or Python programming language and other statistical tools, please contact .. .We're pleased to speak with you during our business hours.. .For international calls please refer to our ...Get in touch today to discover the right solutions for you..We are pleased to speak with you during our standard business hours..\n.\n.\n.For international call please find a number in our ..",

Both are . with active, growing communities; both are are ., and both have a rich set of capabilities for working with data. It really depends most on your interests and the kind of employer you want to work for..If your interests lean more towards traditional statistical analysis and inference as used within industries like manufacturing, finance, and the life sciences, I'd lean towards R. If you're more interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, I'd lean towards Python. But even that's not a hard-and-fast rule: R has excellent support for machine learning and deep learning frameworks, and Python is often used for traditional data science applications..One thing I am quite sure of though: neither Python nor R is inherently better than the other, and arguments on that front are ultimately futile. (Trust me, I've been there.) Which is better for . depends on a wide variety of factors, and for some, it may even be worthwhile to learn both.

        " ― Alan Kay.When I learned how to be a business intelligence analyst, I learned all about ETL, data warehousing, SQL databases, and then at the end Power BI, a product which promised to be able to do everything I had just learned in a single piece of software..Power BI is impressive, having an elaborate ability to ingest data through Power Query, a data storage engine with the same code base as Microsoft’s Enterprise-grade Analysis Services, and a fancy set of visualizations for the front end..So, if the base abilities are so great, why would you want, or need, to use programming languages like . and .. Well, there are at least a few reasons..There are times when you will need to do a more advanced analysis of your data beyond what Power BI can do..Both R and Python are full programming languages with extensive capability for analyzing and manipulating data which can unlock more insights from your data..While Power BI can connect to many data sources, there are a few that it lacks. R and Python are open source languages and as a result, have a plethora of packages and libraries which can be used to extend the language’s abilities..Some of these packages include dealing with specific data sources and file types. They are also capable of some useful visuals..Your organization may have existing solutions written in R or Python, and this code could easily be reused in Power BI. Or perhaps you are already an expert at R or Python..Rather than learning the in and outs of Power Query, you could largely by-pass it with a language you are already familiar with and fast at..Before you can use R or Python in Power BI Desktop, you need to have the language, along with any packages you want to use, installed on your computer..For R, the base installation is the minimum you need, but adding some extra packages, such as ., can help. For Python, you are required to install . and . at a minimum so that it can handle data frames and visuals..Using the options menu in Power BI, you can select which version of the languages you want to use (if you have multiple versions installed), as well as an external editor, which will come in handy later..For R, I recommend . and . for Python (. is also a good editor)..Most of R’s packages are on the smaller side and are meant for a single purpose. Python’s libraries are often large and cover many different functions, although, for performance purposes, it is possible to only import the parts of the package you need..In Power BI Desktop, you are only limited by the packages installed on your computer, in the Power BI Service, you are limited to what has been installed there. Here is a list of the ., and .In this post, I am going to walk through an example that covers the places in Power BI you can use R and Python. This example will use R to scrape a Titanic passenger list from the web..Then use Python to create a Machine Learning model to predict whether a passenger will survive or not, and analyze the effectiveness of the model..The first place you can use these languages is to ., where an R or Python script is listed under the “Other” category. Selecting this opens up a basic text editor where you can type or paste your script..One of the only major limitations in what you can do here is that the script will time out after 30 minutes, so make sure whatever you are doing happens within that time..The script I am running here scrapes a website for the passenger list from the Titanic and splits it into a training and a test set..You may be asked to enable scripts at this point. Also, permissions for the data need to be . if you want to use the scripts in the Service..Once the script has run, Power BI searches the environment for any data frames and then presents you with a screen where you can choose which one(s) you want..Let Iteration Insights get you on the right path, view our services to see how we can help you today..You can then add additional steps as you normally would in Power Query. Additional R and Python scripts are options as well..Choosing these as applied step opens the editor again, with an initial command which loads the table as a data frame called “dataset”..Below is some python code which is added as a second step after the R code collects the Titanic data. This code trains and tests a . machine learning model on the data..One thing to keep in mind with script . is the data size and free space on your hard drive..Power BI will temporarily save copies of the data during the execution of the script steps to a temporary folder on your hard drive (The location of this folder can be changed in the options menu)..Putting all your transformations into one step can limit the amount of data deposited..Once the data is loaded, we can then create visuals with R and Python. In the visuals panel, the icons for both an R and Python visuals. They work pretty much the same and here we will be using the Python visual..Clicking the visual creates a blank visual on the canvas and brings up an editor at the bottom of the screen..You will notice in the editor that there are a few lines of commented code which is automatically added. This code takes the data you added to the visual, puts it into a data frame, and then removes the duplicate rows..If you do not want duplicate rows removed, make sure to add some sort of key column which will make each row unique..Note, there is a limit of 150 thousand rows per visual and it needs to run in 5 min for in Power BI Desktop, and 1 min for the Service..In the top bar, on the right side of the visual, there are several useful buttons. From left to right, they are a button to run the script and update the visual, open the options menu to select the script options you want, and the arrow opens an external editor..Opening an external editor is made easy because as it opens the editor (such as Rstudio or VS Code), it exports the data set as a CSV file, and adds the necessary code to the editor to read in the CSV file..You can then play around until you have a visual you like in the editor, and copy and paste the code back into Power BI..For the Titanic example, here is some code that will create a . visual, which will show us how well our model worked at predicting who lived and died on the Titanic..In this post, I’ve covered how to use the R and Python languages in Power BI to get and transform data and create visualizations. I did this through an example of doing some machine learning using a Titanic data set to create a model that predicts which passenger lived or died..Subscribe to our mailing list to be notified when a new article is released..

        "Most certainly you have read many comparisons between Python and R saying which of the two is better than the other for Data Science. In my opinion both programming languages excel at something. For example, regarding Deep Learining Python is king while in regards of data wrangling… I stick with R. So wouldn’t there be some way to use both languages interchangeably? Yes there is. .. Let’s go for it!.In order to program with R and Python in the same Jupyter Notebook we need 3 basic things that will not be explained on this tutorial. These are:.If you don’t have Jupyter nor Python installed, I would recommed you to install them using ...That was easy right? Now let’s dive into the interesting part;).Once you have Python, R and Jupter Notebook installed, you will have to install R in Jupyter Notebook. This will enable you to use R in Jupyter Notebooks. .Yes, I know this is not much for R users as you could already write R Markdowns in RStudio which is somewhat similar to Jupyter… Unless you’re a Jupyter fan, of course..In order to use R with Jupyter Notebooks you must install the packages within R essentials. To do this, you must run the following command line in Anaconda Prompt:.By doing so, you should already be able to create Jupyter Notebooks using R. To check it out, simply run Jupyter and create a new notebook. If R is displayed as an option, then it works. If it doesn’t show up . might help you..Finally we get to the interesting part: how to program with Python and R in the same Jupyter Notebook..Python and R save their variables in different data types. So, if we want to use both languages together we will need a library that can “translate” Python lists to R vectors, for example..To do so, .. This library generates an interface in Python in which to work with R. Another option would be to use reticulate package that basically it does the opposite: it generates an interface in R in which to work with Python.  If you are more an R programmer, you can find a tutorial on reticulate on . 😉.First, we need to install the rpy2 library. To do so, we could install it directly from pip. However, sometimes it fails, so I wouldn’t recommend installing it this way. The way it has worked for me is:.1. . from .. (Use Ctrl + F or Cmd + F to find it, since it is at the bottom of the page)..2. . (or terminal for Mac users). To do this, go to the folder where it is downloaded with the code “cd path”. Once there, run “pip install [file name .whl]”. Example:.3. .. To do this, the first thing you should do is find what is the path of the R bin folder. In my case, it is located at: “C: \\ Program Files \\ R \\ R-3.6.1 \\ bin”. Once you have it, you have to add it as a PATH environment variable. .‘s how to do it, on both Windows and Mac..4. .. Each one will indicate where R is, who the user is and where the packages are, respectively. In each of them add the following:.After all, we simply launch a Jupyter Notebook in Python and load the library with the following command:.. How? It is super simple: every time you want to use a variable with R (for example, the dataframe df), you must “send” it to R using the following code:.As a result, you can now operate with R inside Python.

        "R and Python have a lot of similarities, but there are some important differences. The biggest, discussed below, is the idea that there is a distinction between a variables and the object associated with it. But before we dive into that, a few smaller differences that tend to get people tripped up:.: When you watch basic Python tutorials, you’ll find yourself wondering where the vectors and data.frames are – don’t worry! They exist, but they’re in distinct libraries called . and ., so basic Python tutorials won’t talk about them..: In R, it’s common to use periods in variable names (like: .). There are many syntax differences between R and Python, but for some reason people really struggle with this one – periods are an operator in Python, so don’t use them in names! The convention is to use underscores, like: ... For example, to get the first entry in a list, you type ., not .. . will get you the . entry in the list..Now the big conceptual difference between Python and R: the variable / object distinction..Say you make a new vector as follows:.In R, there’s no difference between a variable (.) and the object associated with it (the list 1, 2, 3). But this is actually a slight of hand used by R to hide something fundamental about how computers work, and it does not happen in Python..In Python, variables and the objects they point two actually live in two different places in your computer. As a result, in Python it’s best to think of variables as . to the objects they’re associated with, rather than . those objects. Personally, I’ve always liked the analogy of your computer being a big warehouse, and variables are just the entries in the inventory book used by the warehouse manager: the variable tells you how to find the thing you want, but it is not the thing itself..So when you create a new list, Python puts that list somewhere in memory, kind of like how you might put something big on a shelf in a warehouse. The variable associated with that list (say, .) actually just stores the . of the shelf where that list was placed. And because this behavior is normal in most languages, you may not see it emphasized in Python tutorials written by programmers not coming from R..The reason this matters is that it’s possible for multiple variables to be pointed at the same object. As a result, changes made to an object though one variable will impact what you get if you call the other variables pointed at that object! For example:.This is a HUGE place to get in trouble, so please go read the full tutorial on .!",

        "\nThere are literally hundreds of programming languages out there, e.g. the whole alphabet of one letter programming languages is taken. In the area of data science, there are two big contenders: R and Python. Now, why is this blog about R and not Python?.\n.I have to make a confession: I really wanted to like Python. I dug deep into the language and some of its extensions. Yet, it never really worked for me. I think one of the problems is that Python tries to be everybody’s darling. It can do everything… and its opposite. No, really, it is a great language to learn programming but I think it has some really serious flaws. I list some of them here:.One of the main reasons for using Python in the data science arena is shrinking by the day: Neural Networks. The main frameworks like TensorFlow and torch and APIs like Keras used to be called by Python (much of their code is written in C for performance reasons anyway) but there are now excellent wrappers available for R too (see also .)..\nAll in all, I think that R is really the best choice for most data science applications. The learning curve may be a little bit steeper at the beginning but when you get to more sophisticated concepts it becomes easier to use than Python. .If you now want to learn R see this post of mine: .\nI constantly update the post, if there is anything that is not up-to-date please let me know in the comments..\nI created a video for this post (in German):.Minor nitpick – RStudio is not a Microsoft product..Well, Revolution Analytics was bought by Microsoft a few years ago..I guess you are confusing Rstudio with Microsoft R Open (which was Revolution Analytics product until Microsoft bought them)..Oh yes, my fault… Thank you. Will change it in the post..Very good.Why do you even need to introduce a competitive stance, Python OR R, Python v.s. R? Each has pros and cons, but it’s comparing apples and oranges because the use cases are so different. Someone who likes Python could just as easily write a “Why Python for Data Science and not R” post, and it serves no good other than to get people arguing, akin to how one might over “vim vs. emacs.” Maybe it’s better to do data science, and share what you do, instead of fueling another “My favorite software is better than your favorite software” fire?.We are not talking about religion but about tools which are either better suited for a job… or worse. It is important to have this conversation, also to help people make informed decisions about which software to chose. .“Why Python for Data Science and not R” – I would seriously challenge anybody to write this post and post the link here..“Maybe it’s better to do data science, and share what you do” – no worries, I will do that – so stay tuned!.Finally some common sense.Agree..Thanks for your post.  I use R extensively for data science and machine learning, and I love it!  .Just wondering, other than the fact that more people know Python than R, can you come up with good technical reasons to learn / use Python for data science / machine learning projects (instead of R)?.I’d appreciate your thoughts on this.  Thanks!.In fact, I cannot!.The choice of Python could be reasoned with learning through kaggle competitions, where Python dominates and learning is done via sharing of solutions. This learning process is very fast (and competitive) compared to academic learning..It’s good if you want to apply your data science code to do things, since Python is a much broader language..The development pipeline is streamlined with Python. R is better for the actual data science work, in my opinion, but then you might want to deploy your software on a live server, for example, a realm where R doesn’t compete at all. It might, therefore, be more productive to write everything in Python..Have you heared about R shiny?.I have also used Python for data analysis before, for a class whose instructor is a huge Python fan, but I still prefer R. In addition to the reasons you wrote about (I haven’t gone into as much depth as you did into Python), I prefer R because I prefer RStudio and RMarkdown to Jupyter notebook (I’ve also used Jupyter with R before). RMarkdown is integrated in RStudio, so we still get to use the environment, git, help, and Terminal panes, and it’s plain text so it’s easy to see what changed through git. Jupyter notebook is json when viewed as plain text so is harder to see what changed through git. Another thing I like about R is that CRAN and Bioconductor have stricter requirements for packages than PyPI; I’ve seen packages from pip that have terrible documentation and no unit tests. I also find ggplot2 easier to reason with than matplotlib..I have heared that one of major edges that R has comparing to Python is Hadley Wickham, I think it makes senese..Hadley’s “tidy whitey verse” packages are actually one of the reasons why R gets a bad reputation. dplyr (for example) is a slow package for data frame manipulation compared to pandas. The data.table R package for data frame manipulation is significantly faster than pandas in Python so it should be touted more. Hadley Wickham’s dplyr package is definitely not an edge over pandas, so using it as a selling point for why R is better than Python will have you laughed off in front of a bunch of Python developers.. is quite more understandable in code than so(think(dont(really(I)))), don’t you think so? Not everything is speed...The . would be piping, which is a product of the magrittr package. Not dplyr. So my point still stands..You have made a rule : THE FASTER THE BETTER. It’s probably true, but for what? for the CPU or for the human brain? Its a tradeoff actually, I prefer the latter..I.\ndont.\nthink.\neither.\nis.\nparticularly.\nreadable.Excellent point! 🙂.Not if you’re German..From version 4.1 on R also has a native pipe which is even more concise: .Your example:.\n.This is some grade A garbage. So you mention the tidyverse and the only use case you mention is dplyr … ignoring the fact that the point of the tidyverse is that it ‘s more a paradigm/ecosystem to have a much more robust & standardized way to approach many tasks including ML, by leveraging multiple packages (purrr, broom, ggplot, tidyr and WIP like tidymodels, recipes, … and everything that is built on top) in a more standardized, easy to work with way. .And to not stoop to your level of idiocy with blanket statements:.\n– whether it’s an “edge” on Python per se, is up for debate. I don’t use Python enough to judge.  But to call the tidyverse a reason why “R gets a bad reputation” ludicrous.\n– data.table is great.While your opinion is appreciated I would advise you to tone down your language. Qualifications like “garbage” and “idiocy” are not well received here..Triggered?.Thank you for your comment, I have written a blog post on the topic:.\n.Motivation is the key driver to programming speed, so TidyVerse might be faster than less cosy coding prose. Depends on the programmer..Hi Michael, I disagree. .If you are a novice user, you will jump in into DataScience faster thanks to Tidyverse in R. .If you are an advanced user, you will clearly be able to learn fast R and find the fastest route. .I believe your comment is absolutely biassed..Best argument for Julia I’ve read in a while.Yes, we see an interesting development with Julia too. The only problem at the moment is that it is no comparison to R package-wise. But this might change in the future. We will see….I’d add amazing `data.table` R package that outperform any operations with data.frames and AFAIK has no analogy in python..I like **Python** for lots of stuff, including some libraries that are a bit ahead of their R counterparts when I last used them, in particular, the NLTK NLP package and the networkx graph package. I’m sure when I go looking I’ll find **R** implementations in those domains that work just as well..But why I mainly like Python is that it’s an imperative/procedural language, which is the model I grew up on. It’s also what gave me steep learning curve curse. I kept trying to make R work like what I was used to and it refused, for the most part. It even made the comprehensive help pages incomprehensible..But then I dabbled in Haskell enough to come to the realization that **R** is a *functional* language..No one who was able to grasp `f(x) = y` should have trouble making the transition to `y <- f(x)` and, with that realize that **R** is a treasure trove of tested functions that would take years to program in Python or C++, let alone test comprehensively. .That said, the very strength of **R** will be its competitive disadvantage until large organizations start employing programmers and data engineers comfortable in languages like Haskell. They'll pick an easy-to-translate **Python** solution over a hard-to-parse **R** implementation every time..Very well put!.Totally agree!.I remembered saving an infographic DataCamp produced on this topic in 2015:  ..  I can’t speak to the accuracy of the analysis.  Also, 3.5 years is a long time in this field..I’m like you I tried Python but it was too much of a hassle. My only issue with R is the “everything in RAM” problem. I am working on the Kaggle Christmas Traveling Salesman Problem with 197K cities when you get to the optimize route matrix R chokes and asks for another 150GB of memory. I’d like to stay with R but I think the majority of kagglers have gone to Python because of the memory issue.  If you have any ideas about R libraries to use, I would appreciate any suggestions..There are several ways to work with large datasets – just a few pointers:.\n– .\n– .\n– .\n– .Hope that gets you up to speed, no pun intended 😉.Not sure any non pro R comment will have some credit here, but I guess you knew this would be troll bait..Few of your arguments really hold, some are considered even as R weaknesses..The version 2 vs. version 3 topic is mostly over. If you begin now with Python for data science you may even not notice it. Python Software Foundation had the courage to improve the language while others stay with their flaws….Anaconda is the de facto Python distribution for data science, it comes with 200+ packages installed, plus more than 1000+ installable with one command: conda install ..R Studio is really cool, and certainly one of the main plus for R. But it is not R, it would be great with many other languages. But apart R Studio, you have no choice, especially when you have to work on a serious data science code base. Jupyter/JupyterLab is used a lot by data scientists (just check the numbers, no subjective assertion). Visual Studio Code is also getting large adoption, Atom + Hydrogen is very interesting, etc..The function or method topic is the same with R & Python. It comes from the fact that R & Python are multiple paradigm languages, i.e. they supports both a functional and an object-oriented writing. It happens that object-oriented programming is more often used in Python, but it has nothing to do with the properties of Python or R. If some R packages developers would have used object orientation, you would have the same questions in R. It happens it is not the case with the packages you are using, but should someone discovers the advantage of method chaining with objects, the same question would appear..Having data structures as external packages is certainly an advantage from a performance point of view. While R is known for its low performance and poor resources management such as memory, external packages provide the capability to improve performance without requiring changing the core engine. Your own answer to the question about memory issues with R was to point to external packages..About integration with C, you have interfaces both ways between Python & C.  You should have a real look at how easy it is to call C from Python. Also Cython allows to closely embed Python and C extensions and to compile executables for maximum speed. .And finally, Python is more vivid on the side of tools and packages. Many new tools (in deep learning, NLP, etc.) are released with a Python API / wrapper, not so often with R. Once again, check numbers on github for example..But you forgot R Shiny, one of the REAL strength of R ecosystem for prototyping data science applications. Too bad….Thus, except considering old, biais arguments, R is not that much an obvious choice. I would even say it is getting harder. In a recent hackathon of data science with 200+ data scientists competing, I had the chance to do some stats and 1 out 10 was using R, others were using Python. I was not looking to count this, but I was surprised how many Python screens I saw, how few R screens there were. So I did the stats..\nAlso, in its latest poll, KD Nuggets concluded about the changes over time, Python getting more & more used for data science. See: . (no reason to consider KD Nuggets has a Python biais, not your case for R)..Hope this helps to have a better evaluation of pros & cons of each platform..“Not sure any non pro R comment will have some credit here” – your comment is well appreciated, thank you!.I think this is the more objective view. Or at least provides more balance..I have used Fortran, Matlab, R, and Python for scientific computing; and used Python, JavaScript, and Java outside of scientific realm. Both R and Python are fantastic for data science for sure..The real strength of R is its statistical packages made by statisticians..But R’s advantages more or less ends there. If packages are the answer for everything – package for viz, package for speed, etc. – well, Python has a larger pool of choices (perhaps that is a negative). One can have advantage over the other on any given year, but that can change by the next year..I know this post is old, but comparing ggplot2 with matplotlib is like comparing seaborn with base R plotting. Altair is a better implementation of declarative visualisation than ggplot2. Seaborn looks better than both. Plotly Express is easier to use than any. Every time I see these blog posts about Python vs R, and see ggplot2 vs matplotlib is a dead giveaway that the author doesn’t use Python. Much like when I see a university lecturer’s R code that doesn’t use the assignment ( <- ) or piping, I know they don't really know how to program (shame on anybody who still teaches with Stata or Eviews)..In any case, I don't think packages are advantages of the language but more about the ecosystem – and fortunately, the ecosystem for both continue to improve and expand. And if you are only proficient in one, make an effort to learn the other – not just watch a couple of udemy videos, but actually..I guess if you are a statistician, then you don't need to: R is sufficient. If you are a data scientist… nothing would be sufficient on its own, but R is not necessary while Python most certainly is a requirement..A data scientist's role is fluid and quite expansive. Are you going to orchestrate a data engineering pipeline on the cloud with R? No, one would need something like Airflow, Prefect, boto3 – Python would be better suited. Would you trust fitting a GLM with statsmodels over R? Probably not, maybe more complicated models will cause statsmodels to freak out and not converge to a solution while R handles it fine. Would I use either Python or R for a heavy duty Physics simulation? No. Maybe Python, but I'd try out Julia, and in some cases Fortran can be faster than C/C++. What if I was a machine learning engineer in the gaming industry? I'd use C#'s ML.NET or wrestle with C++ perhaps. Maybe I need to custom visualise something using JavaScript and D3.js. Perhaps you need to work with truly massive data and need Spark (using any one of Scala, Python, or R) or Dask (Python)..I'm not saying one person would need to do all of this all the time, but learning how to learn the ecosystem and code idiomatically will take you further than merely learning to write code..I dunno, but if you are a monolingual, or advocate for being one, you'll have a hard time being a data scientist. That's my two cents..One big advantage python has over R is a single object oriented system instead of THREE in the base language (S3, S4, ReferenceClasses) and a fourth, R6, as the tidyverse approach. I also think python is better at manipulating raw  text files in a manner that doesn’t blow up memory. Being able to iterate over a file line by line is very intuitive in python and, while possible in R, isn’t as natural. .But like many in these comments, I use both and am very much a R AND Python proponent. Especially when it’s so easy to interop between the two!.Good points, thank you for your comment..As a statistician, I will provide my opinion. And….\nI think R is made by statistician and for statistician..\nI like R because you just need to open a console in the right directory, type R DF<-read.csv('mytable.csv') et voilà! You can play with the data with the provided packages ..\nI use python and you need more effort to obtain the same result..\nYou can use in R common methods with data scientists but I think this is not the point. .Best.\nDon't forget plumber, opencpu, rmarkdown.I have used both R and Python for Data Science project but I still prefer R to Python. There are 2 main reasons:.\n– There is no “Pipe operator %>%” in Python. Using Pipe make the analysis much easier as it make the process of writing code and the thinking flow closer..\n– RStudio is the outstanding GUI for Data Science, which is better than any GUI for Python (Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook, Rodeo, Spyder…).Though I’m not exactly a scholar in Python since I just started using it since January of this year (2021), I miss R already and I think that I will use it exclusively for analysis work in the future..I have been dealing with virtual environments, conda, anaconda, iPython, Jupyter, PyCharm, IDLE and you name it. Now multiply this times the number of versions of each package of interest ant their compatibility and it quickly becomes a mess. I felt so much relief after reading this, R and RStudio it is for me too..Better late than never (my answer): Thank you for your great feedback, Santi! I really appreciate your view and of course, wholeheartedly agree with you..`sparklyr` is easier than pyspark, if you know dplyr already..\n`data.table` is faster than pandas, and widely used in finance field..\nAnd many other baysian tools like `gstat`,`inla`,`lme4`,`brms`,`shinystan`,`bnlearn` beat the Python counterpart in functionality and usability..\nLast, Python is a submodule in RStudio by `reticulate` R package, in that, no more discussion about who is winner..Very valid points – Thank you, Harry!.I’m surprised that R is more popular than python in the field of data science today, can you tell me some advantages of R compared to python? Many Thanks!.I thought I had given the advantages in the article above… or what do you mean exactly?.As an individual making a living  with data science (“only”) you should evtl. be more concerned about the evolution of auto ML than this battle..Thank you for your comment, René!.Well, at the moment this question . relevant for many aspiring data scientists and on top of that the question doesn’t go away even in the area of Auto ML (where I agree that this topic is going to gain a lot of momentum in the future)..R is also well positioned in this area… I am planning a post on this topic, so stay tuned! (Or even better: would you like to contribute a guest post?).Thank you for asking to be a contributor. I would not pretend  to have enough expertise. I am a seasoned business and marketing professional with solid knowledge and experience in stats and marketing research and some experience in ML using R (and SPSS), not really more. I have registered for a post degree course in data science and it is fully based on Python 🙁  (partly on Knime and Gephi)..Python is catching up with C integration with its Cython library, but your remaining concerns stays as is. Inconsistency between Pandas and NumPy, and function vs method!.Thank you, Maruf, I really appreciate your feedback!.Nice Content!.\nI am learning Django recently for my Project work thank you for highlighting that R is the preferable language to go for when it comes to Data Science. Can you also please make a blog post on the advantages and disadvantages of r and Python, I would appreciate it..\n Keep on Updating us with such great content, Cheers!..Thank you for your great feedback!.I am always open to suggestions. Advantages and disadvantages with respect to what (because I already covered data science)?.Wow its a great article. But I have a question What does it take to become a data scientist? because I want to become a data scientist..Thank you… well, I write most of my posts in such a way that they can be used to learn about data science. Good starting points are the following categories: . and .. I also use many of the posts as teaching material for my data science classes. If you or your company need more customized training or coaching please let me know….I have led decision science teams for big companies and I get this question a lot. I answer it this way. Data science is the combination of domain expertise (like an industry focus), programming, and mathematics. While data science is an awesome field and can be very fulfilling, it can be as frustrating and disappointing as any other career choice, if it isn’t right for you. Many people seem to think about this as a way to get a good job quickly because demand is so high right now. This is not necessarily the case. I encourage people to ask themselves why they want to become a data scientist or any other career choice they may not know much about. Once you answer that for yourself, you can find an awesome career whether it is in data science, engineering, analytics, or something else all together. Here is a link to a “day in the life” post for data scientists who work in corporate settings, that may be helpful.   .While this is certainly interesting, what is your take on the R vs. Python debate?.c’mon, writing in 2018 you should left 2.x vs 3.x dilemma behind… this is over and 99% packages are 3.x compatible…  seems like you desperately need to proof any Python’s weak points which is difficult vs R ?.You are only referring to the supposedly weakest argument… what about the others?.How to developer must learn both.  If you work for a company that has R implemented in its platform you will not come to change that..It might be the case that you have to learn both languages in a company setting but this doesn’t answer which language is better suited for data science..Python is really difficult for programmers!.In what way? Could you be more specific?.I am a beginner and want to start learning some advance analytics. I am a business student and I see marketing trends, reach analysis, big data analysis and likewise things. I am intending to do PhD in business analytics as well. For a complete starter like me, who used SPSS and JASP, what would u suggest? After reading your article, comments and discussion, I thought r for myself. But I need to take endorsement. Inshort, I have to be a data analysis guy. R or Python? Please. And it’s 2020..Well, I would still full-heartedly root for R, especially in the areas you mentioned. In any case, have a look at . which shows you how easy to learn and powerful R is!.My background: 40 years experience with programming, starting with Fortran, Algol, Pascal, and later on C, C++,  MATLAB. Started with R about 20 years ago and do a lot of data analysis both with academic and consulting focus.  Also competed on Kaggle with good results a couple of years ago. Did some programming with Python, but not much. .My simple answer to the question: it depends on what is your actual background and expertise.  The best data science language and programming environment for you is the one you know the most and in depth.  .For people more related to CS in general, I guess Python is the natural way to approach Data Science and this is, I believe, because Python became a very popular general purpose computer language used within CS during last decade or so.  If  you have a lot of non-data science Python expertise, lots of friends that know and use Python, data science with Python is most likely the way to go..People with a background more related to Statistics and/or  long term expertise on R will feel more comfortable staying with R, as they know how to solve data science problems with R. And this is not because tidyverse or RStudio.  It is due to their knowledge on R and on how to solve problems with R and available packages.  Things like RCpp, R Shiny, data.table, ff*, big_*, sparklyr, are, I believe, more relevant for nowadays problem solving  than tidyverse or RStudio..My guess is that comparing the solution given to a data science problem by two real experts,  one on Python and the other on R,  the final result from both approaches will be very similar in general terms. Existing  differences, if any, will be due more to their level of expertise on both programming environments (and techniques used) than on the features of each environment. .I think the original question is more relevant for a person without any knowledge on Python and/or R who wants to start a career on Data Science. For those, both alternatives look comparable to me. Flip a coin? or, better, have some exposure to both worlds and see which is more attractive to you. Both are powerful but have a step learning curve if you want to reach a level of expertise enough for solving large scale problems.  There are no easy shortcuts..Thank you very much for your balanced view on the matter, Adriano..Hello,.Read you post and comments…it is also dilemma for me – R or Python. I have started both, I like R syntax more than Python (maybe it is because I didn’t have programming experience before) but seems that Python is evolving little bit faster that R..\nBut the question is, what would you suggest for sport data analytics? There are few key areas, which has to be covered: web scraping, sport models, machine learning, forecasting, visualization and dashboards..\nMaybe there are another important areas, which I don’t know yet….Thank you for your comment! Concerning sports analytics: I am not an expert here but the things I have seen so far were mostly written in R… but again, I may be biased..You might be interested in my latest post: .Are the reasons still valid after 3 years since the post was released? Hasn’t been there any improvement in Python that makes it better now?.A post update would be very much appreciated!.Thanks in advance..I constantly update the post so all points should be valid. If there is anything that is not up-to-date please let me know!.I’m an economist and I’ve been working with Data Visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI to support my choices regarding project management. I’m thinking about getting a more deep understanding of data analysis (perhaps become a data analyst) and I’m considering taking a course in this. I  have 2 choices: The course from Google that uses R and the other from IBM that teaches Python.  To a person that has no programming background and want to enter in the data analysis world, what would you recommend?.Dear Juan, Thank you for your question. .I would clearly recommend R! Especially when you have no programming background Python might seem tempting because the learning curve seems flatter at the beginning. But the big problem is that when you start doing data analytics with Python you will have to learn a second language on top of the first one because of the necessary packages (NumPy, pandas, etc.).When you learn R everything is consistent because it was originally built for doing data analytics. So you should go for the Google course! Could you perhaps post the link to that course?.Hello Juan! I would like to recommend the HarvardX course R-Basics for Data Science, a first of a series of courses from Harvard via EDx taught by the amazing Professor Rafael Irrizary. It was really very well taught as an introductory course and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also took the Python course from IBM and I have to say I was very disappointed so I’d steer clear of it. If you are a beginner I would also like to recommend Hands on Programming with R (O’Reilly) as a first text, followed by Learning R (O’Reilly), and then R for Data Science – Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data (O’Reilly). These are the best texts in my opinion after going through dozens of books for breadth, depth, and structure. .Best of luck!.I wholeheartedly agree with you that R is better suited for data science than Python exactly for the reasons you have described. I spent the past three months learning R, Python, as well as visualization platforms like Tableau. I worked on all three religiously with no previous background in any whatsoever. In fact, when I started, I was a little wary of R, and was very excited about Python based on how I kept seeing that “it is really easy to learn”/”it is really fun to learn and work with Python” type comments all the time. At the end of these three months, I absolutely LOVE working with R. The syntax is intuitive, the way it works with its parts is pretty straight forward. It took me almost three weeks to just get started with Python because of the many, MANY options available with their various strengths and limitations, which then creates variations in how to get started with any of them. While Python continues to try to be, as you said, “everyones darling”, I am going to continue to work towards mastering R and not Python. PS: Awesome blog!!!.Dear B: Wow!! That is a hell of a story. Thank you for sharing your learning journey with us and keep up the spirit!.Hi, I’m a python user (I can’t call myself an expert, let’s say I’m confident) and a newbie (maybe something more than a newbie) in R..\nI won’t say if one is better than the other (I am not qualified for that). The reality is that python is attracting way more new users than R and it may make the difference in the long run..\nMy humble opinion on why so many new users adopt python instead of R is that python is incredibly easy and fast to learn and, mostly, it is consistent. Yes, the base language (a general purpose language) lacks some features like vectors and matrices but for that there is numpy that is the de facto standard for this task. For tabular data there is pandas (built on top of numpy -consistency, do you remember? – with a lot of additional packages that extend its core functionalities; think about geospatial data for example). Many new packages developed to overcome the limits of pandas (big data, speed and so on) use the same APIs as pandas so to switch to the new library means (mostly) simply change the import  line! Scikit-learn is the standard for machine learning. All this means that after a short training you can open a Kaggle notebook and understand what’s going on; and it works, at least for the vast majority of use cases..\nThis is not true for (base) R! In my humble opinion, (base) R is not as fast and easy to learn as python and, most important, it has many functions that do (almost) the same thing with different syntax and (often) different returns. A nightmare for a new learner (even though I realise that for an experienced developer it may be an advantage; but to become experienced you must start! If you give up at the beginning because of frustration -and switch to python – you will never become an expert).This is where the tidy universe (tidyverse and tidymodels; this comments replies also to your post about dplyr) came into play. “Tidy up” the mess in R world with a simple, straightforward and consistent interface to do things. You can build upon it to extend and improve its functionalities but it aims to become the de facto standard to operate (at least for the vast majority of use-cases). Think about ggplot2 (something that as python user I highly envy to R; data visualisation in python is messy with several different libraries and different syntax): ggplot2 is the base upon which build up adding new functions to extend its core capabilities. Easy to learn and to use (and consistent). Will the tidy universe succeed? I don’t know, what I think (my humble opinion) is that either they will succeed or R will lose its battle..Thank you for your extensive comment, Andrea!.It is interesting to see how different users experience learning a language. For me, it was the exact opposite! I am coming from assembler, Basic, a little bit of Mathematica and Pascal, and later C++. Then I started with Matlab/Octave, Python, and R, at about the same time. I didn’t like the overly commercial approach of Matlab and Octave is just not the same, so I quit. I agree that (base) Python is easy to learn, almost like pseudocode, but I find the vector- and matrix-oriented packages totally inconsistent with it. Also, the sometimes strangely different behaviour of functions and methods irritates me. .Concerning graphics, I agree that R is still THE standard. This is also the reason why all of the big media companies still use it for sophisticated infographics. Although I personally don’t use ggplot2 I can understand its appeal..Oh yeah, and the tidyverse… it might be that I am an “expert” in your sense but what I don’t like and don’t understand is why you would need quite another language on top of R! I am a big fan of functional packages (I developed one myself, OneR) but I don’t like packages which totally change the character of a language. It seems like a hostile takeover to me, some kind of land grab of a commercial company! It might be that had I come later to R I would totally be in love with the tidyverse because I wouldn’t know the elegance and strength of base R. But I do, so I am not a big fan..I wouldn’t be so pessimistic about the future of R. Much of the hype of Python is, in my opinion, based on neural networks which are themselves totally overhyped. As an AI “veteran” I can tell you that all those AI technologies come and go in waves (this is not the first time that neural networks are the latest craze). When there is a new kid on the block (whatever it might be) it will be a new game. It might very well be that R will become the latest craze again (btw something like that happened during the peak of the Covid pandemic because statistical modelling was important again!)..I am optimistic that R is here to stay and will become more important in the future. Concerning the tidyverse: I don’t know, we will see….Thank you very much for you reply. That’s the point: you are an R “expert” and you don’t understand why you should change your mind to adapt to the tidyverse model. But if you were new you would find the tidyverse approach natural and consistent, easy and quick to learn. And it will work in most situations. With the time you can become an expert and find out more efficient ways to solve the problems or how to fix them when tidyverse approach does not work..\nRegarding the “inconsistencies” in python  I would not call them inconsistencies: different libraries may have different settings for default parameters. The fact that you can use both a functional approach (numpy.any( df ==1)) or method approach ( (df==1).any() ) does not mean the two functions are exactly the same (even though they will give the same result if you correctly set the default parameters); this may happen in R too, doesn’t it?.R is much more consistent here, objects do not have methods associated with them in typical R parlance. The class of an object determines what function-methods will be applied to it (= polymorphism)..

        "\n        The Python vs. R debate rages on in the data scientist community. Here's how the two coding languages match up.\n    .Python vs. R is a common debate among ., as both languages are useful for data work and among the . in job postings for data science positions. Each language offers different advantages and disadvantages for data science work, and should be chosen depending on the work you are doing.  .To help data scientists select the right language, Norm Matloff, a professor of computer science at the University of California Davis wrote a . aiming to shed some light on the debate.  . .Matloff compared R and Python across the following 10 domains to determine which programming language was the better choice: .Winner: Python \t\t.While this is subjective, Python greatly reduces the use of parentheses and braces when coding, making it more sleek, Matloff wrote in the post.  .Winner: R \t\t.While data scientists working with Python must learn a lot of material to get started, including NumPy, Pandas and matplotlib, matrix types and basic graphics are already built into base R, Matloff wrote.  .With R, \"the novice can be doing simple data analyses within minutes,\" he added. \"Python libraries can be tricky to configure, even for the systems-savvy, while most R packages run right out of the box.\" .Winner: Tie \t\t.The . (PyPI) has over 183,000 packages, while the . (CRAN) has over 12,000. However, PyPI is rather thin on data science, Matloff wrote.  .\"For example, I once needed code to do fast calculation of nearest-neighbors of a given data point. (NOT code using that to do classification.)\" Matloff wrote. \"I was able to immediately find not one but two packages to do this. By contrast, just now I tried to find nearest-neighbor code for Python and at least with my cursory search, came up empty-handed; there was just one implementation that described itself as simple and straightforward, nothing fast.\"  .When you search the following terms on PyPI, nothing comes up, Matloff added: log-linear model; Poisson regression; instrumental variables; spatial data; familywise error rate.  . .Winner: Python (but not by much)  \t\t. in recent years is partially fueled by the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). While Python offers a number of finely-tuned libraries for image recognition, such as AlexNet, R versions can easily be developed as well, Matloff wrote.  .\"The Python libraries' power comes from setting certain image-smoothing ops, which easily could be implemented in R's Keras wrapper, and for that matter, a pure-R version of TensorFlow could be developed,\" Matloff wrote. \"Meanwhile, I would claim that R's package availability for random forests and gradient boosting are outstanding.\" .Winner: R (by far)  \t\t.Professionals working in machine learning who advocate for Python sometimes have a poor understanding of the statistical issues involved, Matloff wrote. R, on the other hand, was written by statisticians, for statisticians, he added.  .Winner: Tie  \t\t.The base versions of R and Python do not have strong support for multicore computation, Matloff wrote. Python's multiprocessing package is not a good workaround for its other issues, and R's parallel package is not either, he added.  .\"External libraries supporting cluster computation are OK in both languages,\" Matloff wrote. \"Currently Python has better interfaces to GPUs.\" .Winner: R (but not by much)  \t\t.R's Rcpp is a powerful tool for interfacing R to C/C++, Matloff wrote. While Python has tools like swig for doing the same, it is not as powerful, and the Pybind11 package is still being developed. R's new ALTREP idea also has potential for enhancing performance and useability, Matloff wrote; however, the Cython and PyPy variants of Python can sometimes remove the need for explicit C/C++ interface at all, he added.  .Winner: R (but not by much)  \t\t.Though functions are objects in both R and Python, R takes that more seriously, Matloff wrote.  .\"Whenever I work in Python, I'm annoyed by the fact that I cannot print a function to the terminal, which I do a lot in R,\" he wrote. Python has just one OOP paradigm. In R, you have your choice of several, though some may debate that this is a good thing.

        "Data science is increasingly becoming essential for every business to operate efficiently in this modern world. This influences the processes composed together to obtain the required outputs for clients. While machine learning and deep learning sit at the core of data science, the concepts of deep learning become essential to understand as it can help increase the accuracy of final outputs. And when it comes to data science, R and Python are the most popular programming languages used to instruct the machines..Deep learning and machine learning differentiate based on the input data type they use. While machine learning depends upon the ., deep learning uses . to store and process the data during the learning. Deep learning can be described as the subset of machine learning, where the data to be processed is defined in another structure than a normal one..R is developed specifically to support the concepts and implementation of data science and hence, the support provided by this language is incredible as writing codes become much easier with its simple syntax.. is already much popular programming language that can serve more than one development niche without straining even for a bit. The implementation of Python for programming machine learning algorithms is very much popular and the results provided are accurate and faster than any other language. (. or .). And because of its extended support for data science concept implementation, it becomes a tough competitor for R..However, if we compare the charts of popularity, . among data scientists and developers because of its versatility and easier usage during algorithm implementation. However, R outruns Python when it comes to the packages offered to developers specifically expertise in R over Python. Therefore, to conclude which one of them is the best, let’s take an overview of the features and limits offered by both languages..Python was first introduced by Guido Van Rossum who developed it as the successor of .. Python puts white space at the center while increasing the readability of the developed code. It is a general-purpose programming language that simply extends support for various development needs..The packages of Python includes support for web development, software development, GUI (.) development and machine learning also. Using these packages and putting the best development skills forward, excellent solutions can be developed. According to ., Python ranks at the fourth position as the most popular programming language among developers..Benefits for performing enhanced deep learning using Python are:.The latest and stable version of Python has been released as . on 14th October 2019. Developing a software solution using Python becomes much easier as the extended support offered through the packages drives better development and answers every need.. is a language specifically used for the development of statistical software and for statistical data analysis. The primary user base of R contains statisticians and data scientists who are analyzing data. Supported by ., this language is not suitable for the development of websites or applications. R is also an open-source environment that can be used for mining excessive and large amounts of data..R programming language focuses on the output generation but not the speed. The execution speed of programs written in R is comparatively lesser as producing required outputs is the aim not the speed of the process. To use R in any development or mining tasks, it is required to install its . before coding to run the program directly into the command line..R also has its own development environment designed and named .. R also involves several libraries that help in crafting efficient programs to execute mining tasks on the provided data..The benefits offered by R are pretty common and similar to what Python has to offer:.Although R ranks at the 17th position in . list, the support offered by this language has no match. After all, the R language is developed by statisticians for statisticians!.Even when provided with the best technical support and efficient tools, a developer will not be able to provide quality outputs if he/she doesn’t possess the required skills. The point here is, technical skills rank higher than the resources provided. A comparison of these two programming languages is not advisable as they both hold their own set of advantages. However, the developers considering to use both together are less but they obtain maximum benefit from the process..Both these languages have some features in common. For example, if a representative comes asking you if you lend technical support for developing an ., you are directly going to decline as Python and R both do not support mobile app development. To benefit the most and develop excellent solutions using both these programming languages, it is advisable to stop comparing and start collaborating!.Anticipating the future needs of the development industry, there has been a significant development to combine these both excellent programming languages into one. Now, there are two approaches to performing this: either we include R script into Python code or vice versa..Using the available interfaces, packages and extended support from Python we can include R script into the code and enhance the productivity of Python code. Availability of ., . and more resources helps run these two programming languages efficiently while efficiently performing the background work..Either way, using the developed functions and packages made available for integrating Python in R are also effective at providing better results. Available R packages like ., ., ., . and more, integrating Python into R language is very easy..Therefore, using the development skills at their best and maximizing the use of such amazing resources, Python and R can be togetherly used to enhance end results and provide accurate deep learning support..Python and R both are great in their own names and own places. However, because of the wide applications of Python in almost every operation, the annual packages offered to Python developers are less than the developers skilled in using R. However, this doesn’t justify the usability of R. The ultimate decision of choosing between these two languages depends upon the data scientists or developers and their mining requirements..And if a developer or data scientist decides to develop skills for both- Python and R-based development, it turns out to be beneficial in the near future. Choosing any one or both to use in your project depends on the project requirements and expert support on hand..Thank you for explaining this. It’s a well written article..

        "The world is moving towards the next technological wonder. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are the ones leading this from the front. These two things are giving life to things that we haven’t imagined would be true. If you’re aware of this world, then you are also aware of the two programming languages that are always a matter of interest and debate..R and Python are programming languages and both these languages are similar in few ways. They are free to download and use; They are used majorly in data science. Let’s see what these languages are and their usage..Python is an interpreted, high-level object-oriented programming language. It comes with built-in data structures, dynamic typing(a process wherein type checks are done during the runtime), and binding(mapping of different objects with one another), which makes it a top language used for the development of applications. Python syntaxes are simple, easy to read, and easy to learn..The Python interpreter and libraries are free for distribution. Programmers love Python as it helps them increase their code efficiency. As it is an interpreted language, the debugging of the program becomes very easy. It includes libraries like Scikit, Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, etc., that provide sophisticated functionalities. The addition of Jupyter Notebook, a web application to share the code live, makes the data science explanations smooth.. The language is one of the most versatile ones. It is neat, uncomplicated to use, and well structured. Python’s flexibility makes exploratory data analysis hassle-free. Python is object-oriented, but it makes a transition to functional features allowing itself into different paradigms of programming.. Python can be downloaded easily. It has one of the most active supporting forums, and anyone can contribute to improving the libraries and their functionalities.. Python has many libraries that are necessary to carry out major data science-related functions.. Its integration and control capabilities enhance and save a lot of time..Embeddable: Python codes are embeddable. Python codes can be integrated with other programming languages like C++.. Python is an interpreted language and thus is relatively slower than other programming languages..Python is not suitable for android and iOS environments. Developers claim it to be weak language in such an environment. However, it can be used with additional efforts.. Python consumes a significant amount of RAM. The process gets slower when more objects need to be accessed.. Python’s database access layers are underdeveloped in comparison to Java Database Connectivity(JDBC), and Open Database Connectivity(ODBC), making it a less used database connectivity.. Threading or flow of multiple functions at the same time is a downside in Python due to its Global Interpreter Lock(GIL)..R is a programming language for statistical analysis or computing and graphics. R comes with a wide range of statistical techniques such as linear modeling, non-linear modeling, statistical tests, clustering, etc. One of R’s strengths is the ease at which a plot can be produced, including the mathematical notations and formulas..R is available as free software. It compiles and works on UNIX, Windows, and macOS. R allows programmers to add additional functionality by defining user-specific functions. For intensive tasks, the user can link the C and C++ codes during the runtime. R can be extended with other languages like C++ using the packages.. R is an open-source language and is free to download and use. One can also contribute by optimizing its source code.. R is platform-independent and can work on all the operating systems like UNIX, Windows, and Mac.. Through its packages like readr and dplyr, R has the capability of converting a messy code into a structured one.. Through ggplot and plotly, R creates attractive graphs with notations and formulas.. R has numerous packages dedicated to the development of machine learning, data analysis, and statistical projects.. R consumes more memory as all the objects get stored in the physical memory. Over time, as the program has bigger data, the process slows down.. R lacks basic security that makes it practically difficult to embed in web applications.. Unlike Python, R is a complicated language and is difficult for a beginner to learn.. R is a slow processing language. In comparison to other languages such as MATLAB and Python, it takes more time to give an output.. Data handling in R is tedious as it requires all the data to be in one place. It is not ideal for Big Data. However, it does have an integration that makes handling slightly easier..Python and R are the preferred languages in Data Science, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, etc. Although they are used for similar purposes they differ from each other. R mainly focuses on the statistical part of a project while Python is flexible in its usage and data analysis tasks..R is a powerful tool for visualizing data in the form of graphs. It is difficult to use R in a production environment due to its yet-to-develop production tools, whereas Python is easily integrated with a complex work environment..Considering performance, Python is a better option as it runs faster in all the environments than R. Nevertheless, both languages are fan favorites for people to work with depending on their usage..It’s debatable when it comes to the usage of Python and R. Both of these languages come with their advantages and disadvantages. Python is used by a lot of people for multiple people, but R is also under usage. Python is used for a wide range of features, and R is used majorly for statistics. It depends upon the user to pick the language based on the requirement..A: Python is better than R as it can be used for multiple purposes. It has better scalability, performance, integration, etc. However, if the purpose is data analysis and visualization, R is a better option..A: Both Python and R are easier languages to learn. Among these two, Python is easier to learn as the syntax is simpler and the keywords are closer to the English language..A: The demand for R is more than Python in Data Science. R needs specific skill sets when compared to Python which is a multi-purpose language..A: It is not necessary, but it is beneficial to learn R if one knows Python. Knowing it will expand the knowledge in the area of data analysis. It is always good to keep more things in the backpack.",

Many giant IT companies rely and operate on data analysis. .As the demand for data analysis is growing quickly, the market demand for data scientists has also grown enormously.  One should know at least one of the programming languages used for data analysis to give their career an edge in the IT industry. ., all three do an excellent job on the platforms they have set out. To choose amongst them and decide which one is better is a very difficult task. Each has its own set of features that are unique in its own way to curb various requirements.   .However, for professionals who want to build their careers in data science, we have provided exclusive comparisons between these 3-programming languages. .Before starting comparisons, let us first understand all 3 technologies..It is an interactive and interpreted high-level object-oriented programming language. It is known for simplicity and clear syntax which in turn increases readability. It is easy to learn and understand. It is largely used as an open-source scripting language that supports many libraries used for model building or statistical operation on data. It is used by many biggies like Google, Quora, Reddit, etc..SAS has been proved as one of the unchallenged leaders in the field of data science. It is known for its huge variety of statistical functions, good GUI, and great technical support experience. It is also easy to learn. SAS is used by various IT companies like Nestle, Barclays, Volvo, and HSBC. But, it is not open-source and ends up being an expensive option for a beginner..R is a counterpart of SAS and is free as it is an open-source platform. It is mainly used in the academics and research section. As it is open-source, it is highly extensible and there are quick releases of the software with the latest techniques. You can find multiple information sources for R over the web..Let us now compare some factors of Python, SAS, and R to choose the best which suits your requirement..Watch this video on “Top 10 Highest Paying IT Jobs in 2021” and know how to get into these job roles..<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G-vSRFhkeeU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>. computes everything in RAM. This is a big disadvantage of R as it is dependent on a machine’s RAM size. Any task performance can vary and perform as per the machine’s RAM. Although it has been removed. For data management and handling factor, we can conclude that all three of ., ., and R fare equally well as all provide a parallel way of computations..R has a slightly steeper learning curve compared to SAS and Python. Since R is a low-level programming language, it requires proficiency and basic programming orientation. If not correctly implemented, even minor tasks will become Herculean and involve complex code lines. Its overall learning can be considered as average to high..Currently, there is a slight bend for Python in the job market. But due to the dynamic nature of the IT industry, we cannot determine which programming language is better. It totally depends on the requirement specifications and factors like the learning phase and cost. .Below are some cases where we can guide you in choosing the language. Go through it and select whichever is more suitable to your specifications:.If we need to divide these languages over a specific category, then these would be defined as follows:.Now, we hope you got a clear idea about all three languages and believe this knowledge will be helping you to choose the best programming language for your career advancements..If you are interested to learn Python and becoming a Python Expert?

        "There is a good number of programming languages out there being used for web scraping. Python & R are among the most widely used languages in data science. Each of these has its unique features, upsides, as well as downsides, and in this web scraping .comparison article.we’ll be helping you weigh your options..Before we look at what each of these programming languages can and cannot do, let us first understand what web scraping is..Web scraping is also known as web harvesting or web data extraction. The name defines it appropriately, as it implies extracting data from websites..There are different web scraping software that can access the world wide web directly, by means of a web browser. They can also gain access by using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol..Web scraping can be done manually, although the term itself generally refers to an automated process facilitated by bots or web crawlers..It is basically lifting data from the web and copying it into a central local database or spreadsheet. The information that has been lifted will be saved for future retrieval or analysis..Fetching the data is the first step, which involves downloading the webpage. The next step is the extraction process..The content from the webpage can either be reformatted or copied onto a spreadsheet..Generally speaking, web scrapers search for and extract information from a webpage to be used for other purposes..A common example of a web scraping practice is searching for and copying contact information of local or international businesses. This is known as contact scraping..Other web scraping purposes include product price search and comparison, product reviews, current market/stock prices, etc..Searching for and lifting information from web pages may seem like something an internet fraudster would be involved in. As true as this may be, there are a lot of web scrapers who have legitimate intentions. .Small or new businesses use it to gather information in the cheapest, most effective way possible. Larger companies also scrape to gather information for their own legitimate benefits, even though most of them don’t like having bots scraping through their own sites..Looking at it from a general point of view, assuming all intent remains legitimate, then web scraping is a legit means of getting data. However, the courts and law enforcement agencies continue to keep a close eye on web scraping activities. .In the beginning, web scraping was what you could call a “nuisance”, thanks to all the bots scraping all the information they could find from websites. In the year 2000 however, that nuisance led to a preliminary injunction filed by eBay against Bidder’s Edge. eBay claimed that the use of bots against their consent violated Trespass to Chattels law..Eventually, it all ended with an out-of-court settlement, nonetheless, the “legal ball” against web scraping had been set rolling..Another scraping-related legal issue came about in 2001 when a travel agency sued one of its competitors for scraping prices from their website, which the competitor used to set its own prices..It was ruled that even though the scraping did not go down well with the complainant, the act was not enough to be termed “unauthorized access” according to federal hacking laws..During the coming years, courts ruled several times that a simple “do not scrape us” warning on a website’s terms of service page was not a “legally binding” agreement..For such terms to be enforced, the user must clearly agree to the said terms..These rulings by the federal courts were basically “green lights” for scrapers to continue with their web scraping activities..Things were to change in 2009 when Facebook won a copyright suit against a web scraper. This was one of the first web scraping lawsuits won by a complainant..There was a follow-up of lawsuits filed against numerous web scrapers around America, who’s activities could be termed a violation of copyright, and potentially cause significant financial damages to the complainant..The fair use clause, which companies used to defend the act of web scraping had been re-adjusted, and as low as 4.5% of information scraped from a website could no longer be considered to be “fair use”..There are a number of web scraping languages available. For the sake of this article, we will be looking at Python and R..Python is one of the best web scraping languages you can find..Its high-level programming functionality allows users to develop desktop GUI applications and other web applications. It also allows you to focus on the core uses of the application as it handles all other basic programming tasks..It has very simple syntax rules which allow the user to maintain a readable codebase..Python has many useful features, some of which will be listed out below..Python is easy to code since you are not required to insert semi-colons or braces. It is ideal for beginners or those who are new to the practice of web scraping..Python is packed with libraries, including Matlolotlib, Pandas, and Numpy. This makes it ideal for both the extraction and manipulation of data..Using python webscraping, there will be no need for you to define data types for variables. It allows you directly use the variables at any point required..The Python syntax is very easy to understand, this is because reading a Python code is just as simple as reading a sentence in the English language..Being very expressive and easy-to-read, the user can easily tell the difference between several scope/blocks in the code.. The purpose of web scraping, besides sourcing and lifting information, is also to do so in a time-saving manner. If you spend too much time writing the code, then the whole purpose has been defeated..Using web scraping in Python, you can write small codes and use them to execute voluminous tasks. This will help users save time..: Many beginners can get stuck halfway into writing code. If that be the case, you can visit Python’s online community and ask for help in any area where you might have some trouble..Just like Python, R is a web scraping programming language used by statisticians and data hunters to compute, collect, and analyze data. .R has become a very popular language thanks to the quality of plots that the user can work out. These include symbols in mathematics and other statistical formulae..R is packed with a wide variety of functions that make data mining tasks simple..R packages include RVest and RCrawler, both of which are used for data mining. .Basically, this is how R web scraping works..First, you access a web page using R. The next step is to instruct R where to look, and the data to look for on your desired web page..Lastly, when the required data has been found, use R to convert it into a usable format. The Rest package can do this for you..Here’s what R can be used for –.Python and R have quite a few similarities, as well as differences. Let’s first take a look at some of these similarities..As R and Python have similarities, so do they have differences..Here are their major differences –.For those who don’t know, Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed to extract data from HTML, XML, and other similar markup languages..In a case where you find a webpage containing the desired data, but does not provide a means of downloading the data directly, Beautiful Soup can be used to extract content from the webpage, take off the HTML markup, and store the data..Basically, it is a web scraping tool that cleans up and parses extracted web documents..Beautiful Soup installation is very easy using Pip or any other Python installer. You can consult a Python module installation tutorial if you need extra help..For those new to the word, Scrapy is a free and open-source web-crawling framework written in the Python programming language. It was initially designed for web scraping purposes, but it can also be used to pull out data with the use of APIs. It can also be used as a general-purpose web-crawler..As at today, Scrapy is being maintained by a web scraping and development company called ScrapingHub LTD..The Scrapy framework is built around “spiders”, which are assigned a specific set of tasks..Building and scaling large crawling projects is made easy using Scrapy, as it lets developers reuse their code..It also acts as a web crawling shell, which is basically a platform that developers can use to test their thesis on a site’s behavior. .There are many popular companies that make use of Scrapy. These include Parse.ly, Say one Technologies, Lyst, and Po Medialab. . – .Being an open-source programming language, users are not required to pay a fee, neither do they require a license. .Users can also customize their packages, hence contributing to its development..With R, you can re-arrange messy data into a more organized form. Packages like dplyr can help you achieve this..R has over 10,000 packages in the CRAN repository..R libraries such as ggplot2 and plotly have graphs that are visually appealing. .–.R’s origin is shared with the old “S” programming language. Meaning that its base package doesn’t offer support for 3D or dynamic graphics..In comparison to Python, R uses a lot more memory, which makes it an unsuitable option when handling large data..For beginners, they would find the R language much harder to learn..Beginners will find the Python language very easy to learn..Python provides users with an online community that can be consulted if they face any challenges..Users can download Python for free. No license is required..Python offers users many libraries. Including web/game development and machine learning..–.Being an interpreted language, Python is slower than some other languages..Thanks to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), you will experience poor threading with Python..Python as a programming language doesn’t have Android or iOS support..So who wins the web scraping battle, Python or R?.If you’re looking for an easy-to-read programming language with a vast collection of libraries, then go for Python. Keep in mind though, there is no iOS or Android support for it..On the other hand, if you need a more data-specific language, then R may be your best bet..We hope this .article has been helpful.

        "\n.\n.In my . I discussed how we can alter the R & Python story to be predicated on APIs as a way to bridge the language divide. The R & Python love story feels almost like unrequited love .. Much of the development towards integrating the two languages has been heavily focused on the R user experience. While the developments with respect to reticulate have been enormous and cannot go understated, it might be worthwhile exploring another way in which R & Python and, for that matter, Python & R can be utilized together..\n.By shifting from language based tools that call the other language and translate their objects like reticulate and rpy2, to APIs we can develop robust . data science pipelines. I want to provide two motivating examples that explore the interplay between R & Python..\n.When we talk about R & Python we typically are referring to reticulate, whether that be through python code chunks, the . package, or reticulate itself. However, as discussed in my previous post, another way that we can do this is via API. . can be used to create RESTful APIs..On the RStudio Connect demo server there is a . which provides historical stock prices for a few tickers. We can create a simple windowed summary visualization utilizing the Flask app, httr, dplyr, and ggplot2. Let’s break this down. First we use the httr library to send an HTTP request to the Flask app..By sending this HTTP request, we are then kicking off a Python process which returns our dataset. We can then use dplyr to aggregate our dataset as we normally would..Finally we utilize ggplot2 to create the simple visualization..That was simple, right? In the above code chunks we utilized both R and python while only interacting and writing R code. That’s the brilliance of this approach..\n.The less often discussed part of this love story—hence unrequited love story—is how can Python users utilize R within their own workflows. Often machine learning engineers will use Python in combination with Scikit Learn to create their models. To illustrate how we can let both R and Python users shine I wanted to adapt the wonderful . example from the Solutions Engineering team at RStudio..The Bike Prediction project is an example of orchestrating a number of data science artifacts into a holistic system on RStudio Connect that all work in unity. This example could just as well have been written entirely with Python. It could even be written as a combination of both R and Python. And that is what I’d like to illustrate..The bike prediction app utilizes a custom R package and the power of dbplyr to perform scheduled ETL jobs. It is effective, efficient, and already deployed. Say one has a colleague who would like to create a new machine learning model using the same data how can we enable them to do so? The example works within the context of its own R Markdown that retrains the model. Rather than making a one time export of the data from the ETL process, we can make the data available consistently through a RESTful API hosted ...The training and testing data have been made available through a plumber API that is hosted on RStudio Connect. With the data being available through an API, all that is needed to interact with it is the . library. Everything else is as one would anticipate!.In the below code chunk we call the Plumber API using an HTTP request which kicks off an R process. That R process utilizes dbplyr and lubridate to extract and partition data for training and testing..Now that the data have been processed by R and loaded as a pandas dataframe the model training can continue as standard..Through the API both R . Python were able to flourish all the while building extensible infrastructure that can be utilized beyond their own team. The API approach enables the R and Python user to extend their tools beyond their direct team without having to adopt a new toolkit..\n.While data scientists may usually think of APIs as something that they use to interact with SaaS products or extract data, they are also a tool that can be utilized to build out the data science infrastructure of a team. Through Flask, Plumber, and other libraries that turn code into RESTful APIs, data scientists can bridge language divides with exceptional ease. I think we ought to begin to transition the ways in which we think about language divides. We ought to utilize the universal language of HTTP more thoroughly. By creating these APIs we not only can aid other data scientists, but entirely other teams. A React JS web development can then tap into your API to either serve up predictions, extract data, send files, or whatever else you can dream up. Let’s not limit ourselves to one language. Let’s build out APIs to enable all languages to thrive..\n",

Machine learning techniques are being adopted for a variety of applications. From movie recommendations to what food to order or what products to buy, to recognizing your friends in pictures, many websites and applications have . learning algorithms at their core. Look at any complex website like Amazon, Facebook, or Netflix, you’re very likely to find every part of site containing multiple machine learning models. Python has become the de facto standard for many data science applications which combines the . of general-purpose programming languages with the versatility of domain-specific scripting languages like R. However, R is not very fast and the code is poorly written and slow except it comprises of really good statistical libraries compared to Python. So should you use Python or R for machine learning?. . languages for data science in widespread use. So it enjoys a large number of useful add-on libraries developed by its great community. Python combines the power of general-purpose programming languages with the ease-of-use of domain-specific scripting languages like R or MATLAB. It has libraries for visualization, data loading, statistics, natural language processing, image processing, and more. It provides data scientists with a large . of general and special purpose functionality. Over the years, Python has become the de facto standard for many data science applications. As a general-purpose programming language, Python also allows for the creation of complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and web services, and for integration into existing systems.. .R is a powerful, open-source . and an offshoot of a programming language called S. R is a software environment developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman from the University Of Auckland, New Zealand. Although, R was initially developed for and by statisticians, it is now the de facto standard language for statistical computing. Data analysis is done in R by writing scripts and functions in the R programming language. The language provides objects, operators, and functions that make the process of exploring, modeling, and visualizing data a natural one. Data scientists, analysts and statisticians alike use R for statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization. There are many types of models in R spanning an entire ecosystem of machine learning more generally.. .– Python is one of the most popular general-purpose programming languages for data science which combines the power of general-purpose programming languages with the ease-of-use of domain-specific scripting languages like R or MATLAB.

PyBrain is Python neural networks library which offers flexible, easy-to-use algorithms for machine learning. Other popular Python libraries include NumPy and SciPy, which are fundamental packages for scientific computing with Python..– Python is already known for its simplicity in the machine learning ecosystem, which makes it the preferred choice for data analysts. One of the main advantages of using Python is its ability to interact with the code, using a terminal or other tools like the Jupyter Notebook. R, on the other hand, is more popular in data science which is quite challenging to learn. R has a steep learning curve and is really hard to master than Python. Python codes are easier to write and maintain and they are more robust than R. Each package in R requires little bit of understanding first before going all out..– What makes Python a better choice for machine learning is its flexibility for production use. And it’s fast, lightweight, and powerful. Python is a general-purpose language with a readable syntax that gives you great flexibility. With the right tools and libraries, Python can be used to build almost anything and the decorators make you virtually limitless. R, on the other hand, is the de facto standard language for statistical computing and it’s open-source which means source code is open for inspection and modification to anyone who knows how the methods and algorithms work under the hood.. .Both Python and R have robust ecosystems of open source tools and libraries. However, R has more availability of different packages to boost its performance but Python is more powerful, robust than R which makes it ideal for building enterprise-level applications. Python’s speed and flexibility allow it to outperform other languages and frameworks. However, R is not very fast and the code is poorly written and it was created for data scientists in mind, not computers, which makes R noticeably slower than other programming languages including Python. In a nutshell, Python is better at machine learning while R boasts a great community for data exploration and learning.. . .\n.\n\tKhillar, S.  (2019, June 24). .

        "A debate about which language is better suited for Datascience, R or Python, can set off diehard fans of these languages into a tizzy. This post tries to look at some of the different similarities and similar differences between these languages. To a large extent the ease or difficulty in learning R or Python is subjective. I have heard that R has a steeper learning curve than Python and also vice versa. This probably depends on the degree of familiarity with the languuge To a large extent both R an Python do the same thing in just slightly different ways and syntaxes. The ease or the difficulty in the R/Python construct’s largely is in the ‘eyes of the beholder’ nay, programmer’ we could say.  I include my own experience with the languages below..Check out my compact and minimal book  “Practical Machine Learning with R and Python:Third edition- Machine Learning in stereo”  available in Amazon in .($12.99) and .($8.99) versions. My book includes implementations of key ML algorithms and associated measures and metrics. The book is ideal for anybody who is familiar with the concepts and would like a quick reference to the different ML algorithms that can be applied to problems and how to select the best model. Pick your copy today!!.\n.R has the following data types.Python has several data types.A common data type in R is the vector. Python has a similar data type, the list.Python also has certain other data types like the tuple, dictionary etc as shown below. R does not have as many of the data types, nevertheless we can do everything that Python does in R.To know the type of the variable in R we use ‘class’, In Python the corresponding command is ‘type’.To know length in R, use length().To know the length of a list,tuple or dict we can use len().To access help in R we use the ‘?’ or the ‘help’ function.Help in python on any topic involves.The key difference between R and Python with regards to subsetting is that in R the index starts at 1. In Python it starts at 0, much like C,C++ or Java To subset a vector in R we use.Python also uses indices. The difference in Python is that the index starts from 0/.In R we can do many operations on vectors for e.g. element by element addition, subtraction, exponentation,product etc. as show.In Python to do this on lists we need to use the ‘map’ and the ‘lambda’ function as follows.However if we create ndarrays from lists then we can do the element wise addition,subtraction,product, etc. like R. Numpy is really a powerful module with many, many functions for matrix manipulations.To determine the index of an element which satisifies a specific logical condition in R use ‘which’. In the code below the index of element which is equal to 1 is 4.In Python array we can use np.where to get the same effect. The index will be 3 as the index starts from 0.R, by default comes with a set of in-built datasets. There are some datasets which come with the SkiKit- Learn package.We can use the in-built data sets that come with Scikit package.With R you can work with dataframes directly. For more complex dataframe operations in R there are convenient packages like dplyr, reshape2 etc. For Python we need to use the Pandas package. Pandas is quite comprehensive in the list of things we can do with data frames The most common operations on a dataframe are.In R use dim().For Python use .shape.To know the top and bottom rows of a data frame we use head() & tail as shown below for R and Python.In R we can assign a vector to column names.In Python we can assign a list to s.columns.Boxplot can be produced in R using baseplot.Matplotlib is a popular package in Python for plots.Use pandas.read_csv() for Python.The following steps are done for R and Python.\n1.Remove rows with ‘DNB’.\n2.Remove rows with ‘TDNB’.\n3.Remove rows with absent.\n4.Remove the “*” indicating not out.\n5.Remove incomplete rows with NA for R or NaN in Python.\n6.Do a scatter plot.To chain a set of operations we need to use an R package like dplyr. Pandas does this The following operations are done on tendulkar data frame by dplyr for R and Pandas for Python below.Personally, I took to R, much like a ‘duck takes to water’. I found the R syntax very simple and mostly intuitive. R packages like dplyr, ggplot2, reshape2, make the language quite irrestible. R is weakly typed and has only numeric and character types as opposed to the full fledged data types in Python..Python, has too many bells and whistles, which can be a little bewildering to the novice. It is possible that they may be useful as one becomes more experienced with the language. Also I found that installing Python packages sometimes gives errors with Python versions 2.7 or 3.6. This will leave you scrambling to google to find how to fix these problems. These can be quite frustrating. R on the other hand makes installing R packages a breeze..Anyway, this is my current opinion, and like all opinions, may change in the course of time. Let’s see!.I may write a follow up post with more advanced features of R and Python. So do keep checking! Long live R! Viva la Python!.Note: This post was created using RStudio’s RMarkdown which allows you to embed R and Python code snippets. It works perfectly, except that matplotlib’s pyplot does not display..Also see.\n1. .\n2. .\n3. .\n4. .\n5. .\n6. .\n7. .\n8. .\nTo see all posts click .\n\t\t\tVisionary, thought leader and pioneer with 27+ years of experience in the software industry.\t\t\t.\n.Please do more research before posting things like this. While much of it seems correct, the first bit about only 2 data types in R is not..From “?vector”: The atomic modes are “logical”, “integer”, “numeric” (synonym “double”), “complex”, “character” and “raw”..Robert – Thanks for pointing this out. I now remember coming across this when I started on R, but somehow missed this detail. This is also because whenever I check the class(var) it shows numeric. I have also corrected my original post. I have also had the post in R bloggers changed! .How do you find the two different support communities?  Is one community more inclined than another to be hostile or dismissive?  I’ve been wondering if the differences are more social than technical..It would be great to also add Julia to this comparison..This is a good comparison, though I think you didn’t stress enough the fact that most of the stuff presented can be done with base R in a breeze, while in Python most of the time you’ll have to install packages (which means virtual environments, version issues, etc) to add basic functionality. In R when you add packages you add high quality stuff such as the tidyverse..Great article with a lot of information. Please check our new book if you would like to know even more details about this comparison between R and Python..Best Regards.Please follow the link to the book: .in The R section, there is a Typo: # To print a range or a slice. Print from the 3rd to the 5th element.\nprint(a[3:6]).\nYou mean print the 3rd to the 6th element..\nI had worked with R for 7 years before I finally took a Python course: the different subsetting is killing me!.For the data types, one could consider things internally represented with one of the atomic types but really working differently (like factor, Date, POSIXct) also worth mentioning. On hte other hand, the post is long enough as it is..You could leave away the print statements in R..\nI never use print except to show why 0.05-0.02 != 0.04-0.01:  print(0.05-0.02, digits=22)  #  0.030000000000000002.Final thought: this is such a great list. Did you consider creating a two-column landscape pdf with the comparisons side by side? That would make a great reference for anybody switching languages….Berry – I agree the strange subsetting of Pandas dataframe is really a pain. I am getting used to it. I agree.\nthe print() for R is not needed, I just put it there for symmetry. This will be a good reference for me too.\nas I am slowly starting to work more in Python. That was the intention! Someday I will create a table with.\nside by side comparisons..I think that the decision is tied to other aspects of one’s career.  Python expertise can help you in many domains, besides writing statistics papers.  It also depends on the kind of data that you have to load.  In general, Python can handle the more difficult data types..Thank you for sharing this informative article about the various aspects of r and python.

This barrage of information often leaves people confused about how to find the right course, tutorial, book, or other material that can help simplify their learning journey and achieve their personal objectives and needs..The data science community is not alien to this dilemma. To add to the confusion, the recent alleged conduct of established learning platforms led many people, including instructors, to .. These events have furthered the vacuum of trusted sources to help learners pursue their learning paths..In response, a group of like-minded data science community (DSC) enthusiasts came up with the idea of building a community-sourced repository of . and . learning resources, with a primary focus on free materials. This was the genesis of the new . on GitHub..The repository tracks high-quality data science (R and Python) courses and learning resources and provides information on recommended resources in one place. Much of it is curated from the data science community's input sourced through direct interaction through Twitter. In addition, instructors who have been displeased by the alleged behavior of the platforms that host their courses have suggested alternative ways that learners can access the same material. Their suggested course replacements are included in the repository..The Data Science Repo's overarching goal is to provide anyone interested in learning data science with a wealth of industry-best learning materials and learning tracks.

From the state, government, and enterprises to individuals, big data and data analysis have become trends that everyone is familiar with. But you may not have the professional knowledge of data analysis and programming, or you have learned a lot about the theory of data analysis, but you still can't practice it. Here, I will compare the four tools that are most popular with data analysts, ., ., ., and BI, as the basis for getting started with data analysis..The functions of . cover almost any area where data is needed. As far as our general data analysis or academic data analysis work is concerned, the things that R can do mainly include the following aspects..From my point of view, getting started with . is very simple. 10 days of centralized learning is enough for mastering the basic use, basic data structure, data import and export, and simple data visualization. With these bases, when you encounter actual problems, you can find the R package you need to use. By reading R's help files and the information on the network, you can solve specific problems relatively quickly.. and . are both data analysis tools that need to be programmed. The difference is that R is used exclusively in the field of data analysis, while scientific computing and data analysis are just an application branch of Python. Python can also be used to develop web pages, develop games, develop system backends, and do some operation and maintenance work..A current trend is that Python is catching up with R in the field of data analysis. In some respects, it has surpassed R, such as machine learning and text mining. But R still maintains an advantage in the field of statistics. The development of Python in data analysis has modeled some of the features of R in many places. So, if you are still newbie and haven't started learning yet, I suggest you start with ...Both Python and R are easy to learn. But if you learn both at the same time, it will be very confusing because they are very similar in many places. So it is recommended not to learn them at the same time. Wait until you've mastered one of them and then start learning the other one. .If you can only choose one of them to learn because of the limited time, I recommend using .. But I still recommend that you take a look at both. You may hear in some places that Python is more commonly used at work, but solving problems is the most important thing. If you can solve problems efficiently with R, then use R. In fact, Python mimics many features of R, such as DataFrames in the Pandas library. And the visualization package under development, ggplot, mimics the very famous ggplot2 in R..There is a saying in data analysis: the text is not as good as the table, and the table is not as good as the graph. Data visualization is one of the main directions of data analysis. The charts of Excel can meet basic graphics requirements, but this is only the basis. The advanced visualizations require programming. In addition to learning programming languages such as R and Python, you can also choose BI tools that are simple and easy to use. For an introduction to BI, you can read my other article, .Business Intelligence was born for data analysis, and it was born with a very high starting point. The goal is to shorten the time from business data to business decisions. It's about how to use data to influence decisions..The advantage of BI is that it is better at interactions and reporting. It's good at interpreting both historical and real-time data. It can greatly liberate the work of data analysts, promote the data awareness of the entire company, and improve the efficiency of importing data. There are a lot of BI products on the market. Their principle is to build dashboards, through the linkage and drilling of dimensions, to obtain a visual analysis..Published at DZone with permission of ..\n                        .\n.Opinions expressed by DZone contributors are their own..ABOUT US.ADVERTISE.CONTRIBUTE ON DZONE.LEGAL.CONTACT US.Let's be friends:.DZone.com is powered by ",
        "\n.\n.\n.By Lucy Golding,.SAGE Campus Marketing Manager.R and Python are the two popular programming languages used by data analysts and data scientists, that provide many more features than the aforementioned statistical software packages. Although you could learn both, that would require a significant time investment - especially if you have never coded before. So which should you start with? And which one is best for social scientists?. is that learning either R or Python will allow you lots of room to grow as a data analyst. They are similar enough that you can transfer much of what you learn for one language to the other.  Both programming languages are free and and open source and developed in the early 90s - R for statistical analysis, and Python as a general-purpose programming language. One could argue that Python has better libraries for data collection and a wider range of data structures, while R has better statistical and graphics libraries, but the best language for you will often depend on what your community uses..Many people who are new to coding find Python the easier language to learn. It’s also designed as more of a general-purpose language than R, meaning that it is more well suited to interfacing with the rest of your operating and file systems, and more similar to other lower level programming languages like C++ or Java. As social scientists are acquiring new sources of data and new ways to analyze it, the more literate you are in general programming, the more prepared you will be to use tools from other disciplines..Python tends to be more widely used by computer scientists than R, so lots of machine learning libraries tend to be better supported in Python than R. For example, if you are particularly interested in getting into Deep Learning, Python is a better choice. While many of these libraries are being ported to R, the online documentation still tends to be better for Python users. Python also tends to run faster than R at scale, although both are relatively slow in the grand scheme of programming languages . Both R and Python can be linked up to C or C++ for a performance boost, but the average performance of builtin python functions tends to be a bit better..R is and open source statistical computing language, which has traditionally been used by academics and researchers, meaning it inevitably has more packages for statistical analysis. Because of the easy to use, centralized, package dissemination system, most new statistical techniques also tend to get implemented in R before other languages. In particular, if you are interested in network analysis, R is the clear choice over python due to the active R developer community in this area..Some disciplines have a strong bias toward using R scripts in replication materials, so it’s a great way to collaborate with your peers. Because of its open source nature, the latest techniques get released quickly and there are lots of support communities on the internet..R is also great for data visualization. While the base R graphics package is comprehensive and powerful, additional libraries such as ggplot2 and lattice make R the go-to language for power data visualization approaches.   .While each language has its strengths, in all honesty, the differences between R and Python are starting to break down. Most of the common tasks once associated with one language or the other are now doable in both. If you're deciding between the two, and still aren't sure which of the two languages suits your needs best, note that you really can't go wrong since they both can do most of the same things..The best guidance in deciding which language to focus on is to look at what peers in your field are working with, and follow their lead. If your department is more familiar with one language, it could save you a lot of effort if you learn that one. You can always pick up the other one later.  A good idea is to ask any colleagues you have who already focus on data science and advanced analytics to see which language they predominantly use..To explore these languages for yourself, try . or .. .Good luck!.\n.\n.\n",
        "At the forefront of the AI revolution, in a future where data-driven decisions are becoming the norm around the world, lies the continually evolving field of data science. Data scientists are basically the detectives of the tech industry..A good data scientist must have data intuition, an understanding of cause and effect, the motivation to find trends and identify variables, the proficiency to verify whether a method fits a model and the ability to communicate their findings..But behind each data scientist is a programming language that serves as the essential tool allowing them to demonstrate those capabilities — and usually, it comes down to these two languages: . or .Both languages facilitate machine learning, work with large datasets or create complex visualizations. They are free and ., which contribute to their popularity and allow them to have large libraries available..You will find numerous surveys comparing the popularity of these two languages. When you look at the more recent polls that focus on programming languages used for data analysis, R stands out as the clear winner, even when comparing it directly to Python. However, people are switching more frequently over to Python from R..While these numbers demonstrate how each of the languages is flourishing in the world of programming, it’s hard to compare them next to each other, mainly because you will only find R in a data science/statistics environment..Even though you probably won’t be left behind regardless of which one you choose, how do you decide on which one to learn? Is there one that is more cutting-edge?.This is a familiar debate amongst data scientists, and I am going to try and make the breakdown as simple to understand as possible..As a beginner, Python is considered easier to learn. R has a pretty steep learning curve because statisticians developed it for statisticians. Python has an easier-to-learn syntax..The two can definitely reflect on each other. The first stage of data aggregation can be accomplished with Python when you need to scrape data from websites, files or other data sources..Then you could let R apply the optimized statistical analysis routines built into the language to the data that’s been gathered and cleaned for you. You could consider Python the preprocessing library for R..Why don’t you try out R and Python yourself and see what you think?.\nYou can check out tutorials and examples of R on . You can download . and get started with R right away! You can also check out both R and Python online at ... .It is quite possible that you may have to learn both, depending on what company you end up working at and what they use. Job trends have indicated that there an increasing demand for both skills, and the wages are well above average..In truth, the differences between these two languages are growing more and more minimal. At this point, the features that one program or the other could handle are now possible in both. There are even libraries to use Python with R, and vice versa – so you can have the best of both worlds.. Share your thoughts on the latest Starting Out in Tech column ..",

We suppress the . when writing the control table, as these are exactly the values that do not vary inside each record..We combine all of these specification into a . as follows:.Now we can transform our original row-record oriented data into general block records.  To do this we specify a . using our record specification to describe the outgoing record structure. The incoming record structure is implicitly assumed to be single-row records, unless we specify otherwise (using the . argument)..An inverse transform is simply expressed by reversing the roles of the . and . arguments.

        " to the . YouTube channel, home of ., to stay current on all things AI!.Python vs R for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science.Ah yes, the debate about which programming language, Python or R, is better for data science. In this series, I am considering machine learning and artificial intelligence as included in the term data science. This is almost the data science equivalent of tabs vs spaces for software engineers, at least at the time of this writing..This series is intended to be a somewhat definitive guide on this topic, including recommendations for languages and packages (aka libraries) applicable to different use cases, including data science in production and big data scenarios. This series is not intended to give side-by-side code comparisons, as there are plenty of other articles covering that..From my experience, which language to use is one of, if not the first question that someone interested in learning data science wants answered. The world of data science and analytics is vast and can be quite daunting for newcomers. I find that any guidance in determining what languages, tools, and specific tasks to start with is invaluable and highly appreciated..Given that, I’ve written this series to help give guidance to those wanting to start learning more about data science, machine learning, and/or artificial intelligence, and need help choosing a language. This series is also intended for practitioners that wonder which language and packages work best in certain scenarios..Although we’ll cover most considerations in this series, including fundamental computer science concepts, the short answer is that you should learn Python and R, and should definitely learn SQL too. If you’re really feeling ambitious, give Java, C++, and Scala a shot as well. While not specific to data science, the . is a great, up-to-date way to assess the popularity and relevance of different programming languages..When I say ‘learn’, I mean learn fundamental programming concepts and control flow structures, which are applicable to any computer programming language. You should also learn to carry out common tasks with data such as loading, querying, parsing, munging/wrangling, filtering, sorting, aggregating, visualizing, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). Part of this includes learning one or more packages that help with these tasks, which we’ll discuss later in the series..The question isn’t which programming language to learn, it’s why to learn a specific language, when to learn it, and to what degree of expertise. It then becomes how and when to use a certain language and package to achieve certain goals, i.e., the why. For those of you that have read other articles of mine, we will be emphasizing the why throughout our discussion..The rest of this series is intended to help those interested in figuring this all out..Most programming languages implement many concepts, paradigms, and algorithmic flow structures as taught in the field of computer science. This includes things like literals, data types, keywords, operators, statements, expressions, assignments, variables, conditionals, loops, and so on..Therefore, the goal in my opinion is less about mastering any specific programming language, but rather to gain a deep command of these concepts and structures. Once that’s accomplished, all languages should be relatively easy to pick up as needed, and ultimately just becomes a matter of differing syntax..Programming languages differ by design and are characterized by many different attributes. While a full discussion of this is out of scope, there are a few characteristics worth mentioning. Those are code processing and execution, typing, and paradigm. Let’s discuss these in that order..Once written, code is sometimes pre-processed before execution, but other times code is just executed directly. Compiled languages are those that pass code, written by a programmer, through software known as a compiler in order to translate high-level and abstract syntax into very low-level, specific-machine targeted, optimized code. Once the code is compiled, it is executed by a code execution engine or runtime..Languages that are executed on the fly and without requiring a compilation step are known as interpreted languages, and the code execution engine is called an interpreter. These languages tend to be faster to prototype code with, but may not enjoy some of the optimization and performance benefits of running compiled code..The term typing refers to the way in which a programming language handles different types, where a type is simply a designation given to data represented in the written code, and available to a running application (or program), so that the compiler or interpreter knows the data’s intended usage. Types can include numbers (e.g., integers, float), booleans (e.g., true/false), strings, arrays, objects, and so on..From there, a language’s specific typing implementation can be further specified as being either strongly typed or dynamically typed. Strongly typed languages require that all variables and data in code are explicitly declared as a very specific type, and that types must be consistent throughout code flow and execution..Usually compiled languages are strongly typed, and have checks in place at compile time to check for errors and inconsistencies. Having this mechanism promotes and provides type safety. Many software engineers view this as a benefit..Dynamically typed languages, on the other hand, allow that types can be declared or not, and often the types are implicitly determined at runtime. Given that, it’s certainly easier to introduce bugs and other potential issues given the lack of type safety..Despite type safety, this approach is often thought to be much more flexible and often speeds up the development flow, and some say results in increased programmer productivity, efficiency, enjoyment, and so on. Like with strongly typed languages, many software engineers view this as a benefit..The last important thing to note before moving forward, are three of the most prominent and common paradigms of programming languages. These include scripting, procedural, and object-oriented. Note that many programming languages can be characterized by one or more of these paradigms simultaneously..Other common paradigms include imperative, declarative, functional, symbolic, and logic, although we will not be covering those here. Let’s now take a closer look at the three paradigms that we will cover..Scripting or script programming is a relatively simple paradigm. In this paradigm, code is written in script files that are meant to be run or executed by the language’s execution engine, and are usually intended to automate regularly occurring tasks. For scripting languages, the execution engine is usually an interpreter..Scripting languages are executed by loading and running a script file through an interpreter, or also in a terminal running the language’s read–eval–print loop (REPL) interactive environment. This environment allows the programmer to execute command line interface (CLI) commands directly at the prompt in a terminal..Procedural programming is characterized primarily by code organization, coupling, and data scope. Procedural code is written in such a way as to promote code reuse through well-defined functions and modularity, i.e., modules that work together to provide the functionality of a larger program or application. Each module typically is concerned with a certain group of related functionality..Modules contain functions, which are also known as procedures (or routine, subroutine, …), hence the name procedural. These functions can be reused throughout the code, and usually take inputs in order to generate one or more outputs..The more the code is organized into modules, each containing their own independent functionality and having well-defined interfaces (i.e., APIs), the more the code is considered to be loosely coupled. This should definitely be a goal of any software engineer or data scientist..Lastly, data scope refers to the visibility and access of data to individual modules and functions. Often one defines data (e.g., variables) that are either local or global in scope. Data that’s globally scoped is able to be seen and used by code anywhere in the program, whereas locally scoped data is understood by, and available to a single function for example..Data scope, and the related concepts of free and bound variables, can be further characterized using terms such as lexical, block, function, module dynamic, local, global, closure, and immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). Further discussion is out of scope for this article, no pun intended :).Object-oriented programming (OOP) centers on the idea of objects in code, which are created from templates known as classes. These objects have self-contained (i.e., encapsulated) properties and methods..For example, let’s say you’re building an application to sell used cars. The code could be written to define a car class as a template for individual car objects created (i.e., instantiated) from the class. Object properties are static values that characterize the object, whereas object methods (functions) represent functionality or actions that the object can perform..Continuing with the car example, one could instantiate a car object from the car class, and give it properties like year, make, model, and selling price. As you can see, while all cars in this application will have these properties (as defined by the class), each car object will have different values (e.g., 2017 Audi A3: $20K, 2012 Honda Fit: $7K)..Object methods associated with cars could represent functionality like set year, mark as sold, add review, and so on. Methods usually follow naming conventions such as SetYear, setYear, or set_year. They are also often used to modify the values of certain object properties rather than allowing the properties to be modified directly..Object-oriented programming also involves many more concepts that are out of scope here, including abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, composition, interface, and so on..Python is a multi-paradigm programming language that can be characterized as a dynamically-typed, scripting, procedural, interpreted, and object-oriented language. It comes with a very comprehensive built-in library called the standard library. Python’s built in functionality, power, and flexibility are strong reasons for learning it..Python is also multi-purpose, and can be used for everything from data science, to system and network administration, building web applications, running utility scripts on your local machine, and so on..Python is also a relatively simple language as compared to some others (e.g., Java, C#), and should be easy to learn for those completely new to computer programming. With the help of an online tutorial or two, someone new to the language can write simple working Python code in no time flat..Python also enjoys a massive community, both online and in general. Anything that one wishes to do with the language, learn about, or have answered, should find it very easy to quickly find appropriate resources..Python has become a formidable language in the data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning spheres. This is largely due to the language’s flexibility and community, but it’s also a direct result of the production of many ultra-powerful, high-quality packages and modules..These packages are fully capable of carrying out tasks such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, predictive analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence (neural networks and deep learning), recommender systems, and the list goes on..One nice aspect of Python and its package ecosystem, and depending on perspective, is that while there are many packages available, certain ones stand out and are much more popular than others (scikit-learn for example). Given that, users can accomplish a tremendous amount just by using a relatively small group of very well known packages (discussed more later)..On the other hand, Python’s usefulness for data science was previously criticized for lack of packages and functionality as compared to R, although that gap has certainly continued to close..As compared to the R package ecosystem, Python packages usually need to be obtained from the vendor themselves, or by using a package management software such as Anaconda, Miniconda, or PIP (see PyPI, Python’s package index)..Python’s lack of a single centralized package repository, which R does have, isn’t necessarily a bad thing, although it does make package installation and maintenance (e.g., updating) become a little more involved..Lastly, many point out the Python is much more performant (i.e., faster) as compared to R, which some people believe is significantly slower for certain tasks. That said, I’ve also read articles claiming that an enhanced R distribution, Microsoft R, is now faster, but I have not verified that..Like Python, R is a multi-paradigm language that can be characterized as a dynamically-typed, scripting, procedural, and interpreted language. It can also support a type of object-oriented programming, but is less known for that as compared to Python..R is considered statistical software (similar to SAS and SPSS) and is very specialized and well-suited for statistics, data analysis, and data visualization. It is therefore less flexible and diverse of a language as compared to Python. That said, due to its specialization, R enjoys a vast community of people also specialized in these fields..R has a relatively strange syntax in my opinion, but that’s not a bad thing. It’s not a particularly difficult language to learn once you understand the CS fundamentals mentioned earlier, but it’s gotten the reputation of having a very steep learning curve from some people..One way that R definitely sets itself apart from Python is in its natural implementation and support of matrix arithmetic and associated data structures such as vectors and matrices. It’s on par with Matlab and Octave in that regard, and similar implementation in Python usually involves the numpy package, which some think is a clumsier implementation..It’s also worth noting that many view R as being superior to Python for both statistics and data visualization in terms of packages, implementation details, and final aesthetic results for visualizations..R also has a significant and very large repository of curated packages known as CRAN. CRAN is a centralized and well-maintained repository of all packages available to the R language, and includes many very powerful and useful packages applicable to a large number of tasks..While popular Python packages are straightforward and easy to identify and get started with, there seem to be way more packages available for R, and many of them highly specialized and relatively obscure. I find it to be a little less clear what packages are best for what tasks, but there are plenty of great ones to choose from..Both Python and R have extensive command line interfaces (CLIs) which can be leveraged via a terminal running the language’s read–eval–print loop (REPL) interactive environment..The most popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming is R Studio, and I must say, it’s pretty awesome. R programs and tasks can also be run from plain text files in combination with a terminal running the R REPL environment and CLI..The concept of reproducible research and reporting, and subsequently the many notebook options used to produce it, is very popular with both R and Python. For R, the most common notebook and reporting tools are R Markdown and Knitr..Unlike R, Python doesn’t really have a somewhat “official” IDE like R Studio. Two of the most common Python IDEs are Rodeo and Spyder, although any text editor can be considered an IDE in the same way as with R. Python code and scripts can also be run via the Python REPL environment and CLI..Reproducible research and notebooks-wise, you’d be hard pressed to find a data scientist writing Python code that isn’t also using Jupyter notebooks. In fact, Jupyter is often used as a primary IDE for Python programming in general..We’ve had a thorough discussion of both languages, along with their characteristics and associated paradigms. Now let’s talk about which language to use, when, and why..The first thing worth mentioning is that both languages, and many packages written for each, are very solid and highly capable. You aren’t making an incorrect choice going one way or the other, at least initially. In certain situations that we’ll discuss here, one language or the other may be better suited for a certain situation or use case, or perhaps even a different language such as Scala (for Spark), C++, etc..Cutting to the chase, I recommend to most beginners to start with Python with Jupyter notebooks. It’s very easy to learn and get up and running relatively quickly. Learning Python will also expose newcomers to object-oriented programming, although one can certainly write Python code in a more scripting/procedural fashion without delving into OOP..For a very comprehensive and useful infographic comparing both languages, I highly recommend taking a look at DataCamp’s . on the subject here..Further considerations should include the situations where data science tasks (analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence) are carried out either on a local desktop or laptop machine by a data scientist (for example), or where these tasks are performed on servers (usually in the cloud). In the latter case, servers can either be a single server, or a distributed system (described below)..I further differentiate between performing these tasks for development or production purposes, where production implementations and deployments have a unique set of considerations, challenges, and requirements (e.g., packaging, devops, site reliability, rollback/failover, monitoring, …)..Lastly, and from a requirements perspective, we must also consider whether production deployments produce results in real-time or near real-time, and also whether a given task’s deliverable (e.g., predictive model, classifier, recommender system) is trained to a target level of performance either offline or online..The next InnoArchiTech article will cover all of this in depth, along with suggestions and recommendations for which languages, packages, and platforms should be considered for each scenario..I hope you have been able to learn something about the most popular programming languages used for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science tasks..Keep in mind that things change over time, and there’s usually not one single perfect solution for every use case. Sometimes experimentation and testing is needed to find the optimal solution..The next article will be a continuation of this guide, and will focus on which languages, packages, and platforms are best suited for certain use cases and environments..Good luck on your data science pursuits, and stay tuned!.Alex is the founder of . and., as well as the author of . published by O’Reilly Media.",

        "Before assessing R and Python, I will start with Wolfram Mathematica. It's a powerful software, similar to MatLab. You can handle lists and matrices easily, you have all the best mathematical functions, backup of Wolfram Alpha and extremely sophisticated graphics visualizations, that allow you, for instance, to make and visualize an animated gradient descent, animate different weights for a given neural network, choose a specific Machine Learning algorithm and automatically classify your dataset in classes, plot stunning 3D visualizations, make animations and manipulate variables values dynamically at the same time you see the output of your calculation. It has 4.65 Gb size and comes with all libraries integrated. It's a great program when you know the formulae for Machine Learning algorithms, so you can build them from scratch, in a completely customized way. You can also do face recognition, geolocation of objects with 3D plots of map surface, handle cellular automata like any other and develop social networks models with artificial intelligence completely customized. You can even develop a self driving car project, see the work on the YouTube video. Below you can see a Support Vector Machine in 3D..\n.However, market demands a skill set where R and/or Python are essential. R is extremely easy to learn and free program, with lots of libraries (on demand, what makes the software faster) including ALL Machine Learning algorithms, including Neural Networks and Deep Learning. You can also build models from scratch (like face recognition), faster than a software like MatLab or Mathematica. Almost everything is automatic. All Machine Learning Algorithms have hyper parameter tuning, what makes extremely easy to build a model. But as you add more libraries, the software becomes slower, also affected by for/while loops. Statistics is an extremely strong feature, better than any other software. You can draw maps, make geolocation easily, animations. Besides, stackoverflow, CRAN and R-bloggers also help a lot. Ah, you can also handle missing values and outliers very easily, rather than just replacing my mean. R may be connected to Microsoft Azure Machine Learning or RapidMiner..In my point of view, R is perfect when you have a quite large dataset (you can also run calculations in the cloud), for any business that really prefer quality of analysis over quantity. If you want details, R is the right choice. You can even detect faces and objects with R..But then comes Python, where you can customize everything..Python is excellent when you want to create APIs, handle large datasets 2 X (or more) faster than R and Mathematica, when you want o build models from scratch, if you have knowledge about Machine Learning algorithms, their formulae. It's easy to learn by yourself and have a good online support (stackoverflow, github, etc). Neural networks modeling is a piece of cake, once you learn to get the best from online sources. Python escalates easily, it's a slim software (I mean not fat), but lacks a more detailed description regarding statistical analysis. You can do face recognition in full, using OpenCV, Convolutional Neural Networks, pattern recognition, also geolocation using Jupyter and use all Machine Learning softwares. Graphics in Python is not advanced and in my point of view, it's the perfect software for handling big data and automating Data Science tasks. Python may run with Tensorflow and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and use a cloud service like Amazon. Definitely a software to fall in love with..\n. .Tags:. .\n.\n.\n.\n.Comment.When I read about people that complain about R being slow, I wonder how well they know R and the tricks (and packages) needed to work really fast. For example it is possible to speed-up R 3X or 4X using multi-core linear algebra libraries like openblas. Usually it is as easy as symlink the openblas libraries to get the speed improvement for all packages and LA operations. The same type of improvement is possible using openblas with numpy in python, but require compilation and is available only when using numpy directly or indirectly. Another great package is data.table..Rubens,  I was just surprised by the finding that Python or R will be faster than . mathematica.  In CS, it is a fact that a code in C runs faster than one in Java, and a code in Java runs faster than one in R or Python.  As a code speed dependents on its construction ( its time O()), and the language it is written in, and the platform it is running in. It makes sense to assume that Python code will be slower than a C code.  Hence, if a code is written in Mathematica, Mathematica is written in C, and the Mathematica code is compiled, logic implies that the compiled Mathematica code will be faster than a Python.  Of course if you don't compile than the assumption that the Mathematica code will be faster than a Python code does't apply..From my experience, at the end of the day it is the customer that decides which language they need you to use. In finance, most of my code is in Matlab.  As an Adjunct Prof. I have to teach SAS.  Many large organizations and the government relay on SAS and they require our students to know SAS..By the way, I do agree with you on R and machine learning.  It has over 100 predictive models, many I've never heard of.  I also like the packages for Linear Regression.  They have extensive tools to diagnose your model..Here is a link to a blog where I build predictive models to predict Geico Callers.  I used mostly R except for the RandomForest where I used Mathematica..Dalila, I agree with you, graphs in Mathematica have much higher resolution, far better than R or Python. Regarding speed, I solved the MNIST task with Python in half of the time spent with Mathematica. At the same time, drawing a social network with 2,000 nodes took Python one tenth of the time spent with Mathematica. Regarding speed, R is the laggard, but it has much more simple ways to implement Machine Learning algorithms, like Python..Mathematica ML package comes with Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, KNN and Random Forest. Only. We know there are several other algorithms for ML. Ok, you can develop them from scratch in Mathematica, but it's not necessary if you have Python or R. I didn't explore Python features on Graph analysis, but sincerely I believe it can do the same job as Mathematica..Mathematica has a lot of tricks to improve performance, as setting up the JVM, writing an efficient code, avoid N[list] code, parallel kernels, Hadoop link, CUDA link, etc. I notice there is a lack of community enlightment regarding Mathematica. The code is kept complicated what makes hard to adopt the software. Demonstrations area is full of examples, but it's really hard for beginners. You can find R and Python resources absolutely anywhere, different models, packages what makes easier to learn, develop and adapt models and hyperparameters. I wish we could have the option to load Mathematica libraries on demand, according to the code selected. This would make it really faster. But lately I've been coding in R and Python, with excellent results..I understand that many data scientists deal with traditional datasets, and R has enough packages to meet the needs of these data scientists.  .I use both R and Mathematica.  I like that R has a large implementations of Predictive Models, more than any other language, and that it is easy to build and test your models.  Therefore, I use R to develop predictive models.  However, when you go beyond the traditional datasets, I found it very slow and not as reliable as Mathematica.  I have used both for text mining, and R is very far behind Mathematica.  The text mining packages are not to the Mathematica maturity or even accuracy.  I also created Community Graphs in Mathematica which take fraction of time of packages in R, with higher resolution and accuracy.  .By the way, Python is written over JVM, as is R.  Both are slower than Mathematica, especially if Mathematica is compiled.  Mathematica is written in C (faster than Java.)  In addition, Mathematica has more distributions  implemented than R.  .One more thing, few are aware of, you can implement TensorFlow in Mathematica..Here is a link comparing both R and Mathematica .One more point, I have been using Mathematica for Graph Network building and analysis.  It is much much faster than R..I'm just a data scientist, I don't work for Mathematica, or represent it..Excellent summary of the strengths and weaknesses of three of the most widely used analytics platforms. I personally am most comfortable in R, and have dabbled in Python. Your assessment of Mathematica is of great help, as I haven't been able to say much one way or the other about it before. Thanks!.It's true that many data science positions require both R AND Python. I've done a quick study to see which languages are most popular on the job market. .I have to agree with what you have posted up here. I personally think that every data scientist should have experience in both (I don't think I could ever give up the ease / quality of shiny or markdown in R OR the ease of fit, transform, score, repeat of Python ML). I teach a basic analytics class for C-level executives who want to get visuals of these analysis algorithms and the programming behind them. Learners with no prior programming experience really love how automatic/ intuitive R is and it makes more sense to them (at least in my experience). Strong analysis skill is such an important skill set in our time and if a program easily allows someone to learn and perform their analysis with little programming experience - it's an incredible tool! .\n.\n.Welcome to.Data Science Central.or .Posted 9 November 2021.\n© 2021   TechTarget, Inc.  \nPowered by. .\n.  | \n.  | \n.  | \n.\n. .:.\n.\n",
        "If you are someone who wishes to make a career in ., then the ultimate question you have to face is, which programming language you should learn and why? There have been numerous discussions on public forums with people advocating for R or Python for plenty of reasons..Though it completely depends on your choice, comparing both the languages on some grounds will surely help you make the right decision..\n.\n. is an . developed for ...Like R, . is also an . that was initially developed as a general-purpose programming language, and later branched out to be a language for . . ...Let’s understand the difference between these two highly popular Data Science languages:.Well to start with, R packages are solely managed by . . repository that manages the updated versions, their installations, and related documentation of R Packages. All the packages you install in R are stored in CRAN. Also, any new package to be added in R should be submitted to CRAN. Currently CRAN has over 16000 additional statistical packages. This is why it is easier to install R..On the other hand, Python has two package management platforms, . and . (Python Package Index) that include over 100k Python packages. There have been inconsistencies found in Packages, Libraries, and Versions while installing Python due to two repositories. Due to this reason, it is a little tedious to install Python..R has all the features that Python has in terms of programming ability, statistical computing and modeling, but Python is more flexible and robust. Python is a better option when it comes to integrating it with web applications and production..However, R is less robust and versatile, which is why it is limited to statistical computing and mathematical modeling..One of the most frequently asked questions is “.?”.Both R and Python have almost similar features, but when it comes to syntax, . and is better for someone who is already familiar with other programming language. On the other hand, . and hence, for anyone who is about to start-off with a programming language, Python is a good option..However, when the model building becomes complicated, it requires someone who is proficient in Python..Usually .. When the number of iterations increases, R typically surpasses Python’s speed. In comparison to Python, R requires more lines of codes to perform a certain task, which make the programs more complex and bulkier..R was designed for statistical computation and Modeling purposes and hence it performs better for any level of complex computation. .. Python being a general programming language somehow lacks the packages and libraries for Data Science. Python is better suited for modeling and machine learning, which is complicated in R..The focus of R is primarily into statistical analysis and hence it is better suited to academia and research. On the other hand, Python being the programming language for all purposes is suitable for tech industry. However, Python also comes with packages that can create an environment similar to R..There are plenty of other grounds that differentiate R from Python. The following table will further clarify that!.The above table must have given you a clear idea about the bases R and Python differ on. But the difference alone will not suffice in answering why you should learn any Programming language. Let’s take a look at reasons why should learn either of these in the following section..Before deciding upon the programming language you want to learn, you should consider some pre-requisites as they are going to heavily impact your career choices and the skill-set as a whole..If you wish to become a machine learning expert or a software development professional, Python will be the right choice for you. However, if you want to conduct a research and test hypothesis with the help of statistics, R will be the right choice for you..If you are someone who has experience in programming languages, then R will be easier for you to begin with as you will be able to correlate the syntax and the logic. However, if you are a beginner, who has no prior experience in programming, Python is a better option..Also, even if you have knowledge of . language like Java or C++, then you should go for Python, as it is based on OOP concept..If you wish to develop an application, implement a machine learning model, or wish to simply create visualization for your data, you should learn Python. On the other hand, if your aim is to do time-series analysis, signal processing, data mining, etc., on the dataset, you should learn R..Both R and Python have all the functionalities that you would need for Data Analysis or Data Science projects. However, as said before, it depends on the . and the . you are looking for..If the business problem requires modeling machine learning algorithms, then Python is the right choice. On the other hand, if business problem includes researching a hypothesis and finding a solution by plotting graphs and charts, then R is the right language for you..If the dataset is large and complex and requires numerical analysis, then R is a better option than Python, as R was built as a statistical and computational programming language. This gives R better functionalities in this matter. However, if your project involves building machine learning models, then python is better..One fact that one should keep in mind is that .. It has limited packages for in-depth Data Science and Data Analytics. On the other hand, .because of its vast environment..The answer to this question is: .. Python and R both have different sets of pros and cons and are suitable for different problem statements.  But . by most of data scientists because of the linear learning curve and flexibility to be integrated into other applications..However, as the complexity of the problem increases, the proficiency level required for solving the issue increases..Moreover, it is possible to .. This is called .. ., data frames can be written in either language, and can be saved and read by the other seamlessly..Both R and Python are heavily used in real-world and have a plethora of applications. Take a look below:. • . Python is used in web application development in a much easier way. It can also be used for writing gaming applications, enterprise-level applications, Machine Learning applications, image processing, text processing, etc.. •.Python is suitable for IoT development as it supports big data, real-time analytics, and much more. Python’s flexibility and embedding ability makes this language the best choice for IoT projects. .• . For Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, a language is required that is flexible, stable, secure, and has features that support the unique requirements of Machine Learning projects. Python is filled with packages and libraries which are highly useful for this purpose.. • . Fin-tech industry is one of the most dynamic industries among all. Hence, using a programming language that is easy to learn, implement, integrate, and optimize is of utmost importance. Therefore, people in this industry use Python as their primary programming language. .Some of the ways in which R is used in real-world are:.As per . ., . only after C and Java. Python was at position 4 in 2019, which clearly shows the increase in popularity. On the other hand, ., which was at position 21 last, which also shows a huge spike in the popularity of this language.. .: .: .It is clearly visible that Python is getting more popularity than R among the industries. And if we look at the history, since 1995, Python has come a long way in terms of gaining prominence among the programmers. Although R has its own niche, looking at the data, anyone can predict that there will be more job opportunities for Python in the coming years..Looking at the career prospects and growing popularity, Python is the better option to go for first. But again it all depends on the factors discussed in previous sections..Well, once you have made the decision about which language to go first, the first question that pops into your head must be “.?”. So there are plenty of resources to learn among which some of the popular ones are:.
