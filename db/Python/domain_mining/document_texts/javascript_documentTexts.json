        "Python or JavaScript? While we’re still arguing over which has the upper hand or the brighter future, little doubt exists as to which owns the web’s front end. It’s JavaScript in the browser or nothing..Well, maybe not . JavaScript is a favorite target language for “transpilers” that convert one programming language into another (see: ., ., ., .). And Python’s huge following and wealth of available libraries make it a great candidate to be converted, i.e. transpiled, into JavaScript..Here are four current projects for making Python useful in the JavaScript world. One stands out by being able to convert in both directions..One of the promises . makes is to allow us to use any language we choose to develop for the web, though this remains a distant goal. The philosophy behind ., at least as far as Python 3 is concerned, is why wait?.Brython implements a version of Python 3 for client-side web programming via a JavaScript library that emulates all of the keywords and most of the built-ins for Python 3. Scripts written in Python can be included directly in a webpage. Brython supplies a high-level Python module interface (the .package) to interact with the DOM and the browser, i.e. to handle all of the work normally done directly in JavaScript..Plenty of . and a . demonstrate how it all works. It’s even possible to use Brython to write a .in Python. Async functionality is available, although you have to use Brython’s . module instead of Python’s ...Brython does not escape the restrictions imposed on JavaScript in the browser. For example, there is no support for dealing with the local file system. There is, however, ., if all you need is some way to persist data on a per-application basis.. focuses strictly on translating Python 3.5 and later code to JavaScript, without trying to provide full in-browser support as per projects like Brython. It emits ES6 code to minimize the need for polyfills on the browser side, and plays well with tools like Webpack by preserving source maps..Most of Python’s common keywords and behaviors are supported, including . and ., Python 3.6 f-strings, and Python class methods and inheritances. You can also insert JavaScript inline via a special function call, if you ever need to drop down to JavaScript directly..Note that the last commits to the JavaScripthon project were in May 2018, so it hasn’t received support for the latest Python features such as the “walrus operator.” But anyone using Python 3.6 features should be well supported..The . name is an abbreviation of “JavaScript in, Python out.” In other words, Jiphy converts in both directions between the two languages. Plus, code from both languages can be intermixed before being converted to either target language..Before you dive in and start converting all of OpenStack to JavaScript, take heed: Jiphy is not about full-blown codebase conversion. Rather, its function is, as the README puts it, “to reduce the context switching necessary for a Python developer to write JavaScript code and vice versa.”.The biggest drawback to Jiphy is that it supports only a subset of Python’s features. Neither classes nor default arguments are available, although decorators and exceptions are supported. Much of this is because Jiphy strives for a line-to-line relationship between the source and target code, but its developers have eyed the . for more advanced Python feature support..Note that the Jiphy project hasn’t been updated since late 2017. Jiphy should be considered strictly experimental until work on it resumes.. converts JavaScript to Python, as the name implies, using a pure-Python conversion engine. It has official support only for ES5 right now, although there’s experimental ES6 support for the brave and bold..JS2Py supports a great deal of cross-interoperation between Python and JavaScript. You can import existing Node.js modules in your Python code, by way of a . method. Variables from the JavaScript side can be evaluated on the Python side, and Python objects can be used from JavaScript code as well..JS2Py also includes a highly experimental virtual machine that evaluates JavaScript code from Python, but it’s not recommended for production use yet.. promises “Pythonic JavaScript that doesn’t suck.” The project is similar to CoffeeScript in that it ingests code written in an alternative language – in this case, a flavor of Python – and generates JavaScript that can run anywhere as-is. .Thus RapydScript provides the best of both worlds, bringing Python’s clean syntax to JavaScript capabilities like anonymous functions, DOM manipulation, and the ability to leverage JavaScript libraries like jQuery or the Node.js core. That’s right—you can use Rapydscript-generated code to drive webpages or Node apps. .Another convenient feature of RapydScrypt: It offers both Python and JavaScript nomenclatures for certain operations when possible. For instance, the . special symbol used by jQuery works as-is in RapydScript, and arrays can support both the . (JavaScript) and . (Python) methods..If you hear the name Transcrypt and think TypeScript, you’re not far off the mark. . follows the same basic idea—it transpiles Python to JavaScript. It also tries to preserve, wherever possible, the structure and the idioms of the original Python code, including constructs like lambdas and multiple inheritance across classes..What’s more, source maps can be generated for the transpiled code that point back to the original Python, so developers can debug using that code instead of the generated JavaScript. According to the documentation, Transcrypt accomplishes these tasks with CPython’s Abstract Syntax Tree module, which allows programmatic access to the way Python parses its own code..One of Transcrypt’s biggest advantages is automatic access to JavaScript’s Document Object Model (DOM). If you try to access . in Python, for instance, the converted code will use the actual . in JavaScript..An associated project, and one still heavily under wraps, is ., which ports the NumPy math-and-stats library to JavaScript. So far Numscrypt provides only a subset of NumPy’s features, though these features (e.g., matrix math) are among the most commonly used. However, Numscrypt hasn’t been updated since 2018..Serdar Yegulalp is a senior writer at InfoWorld, focused on machine learning, containerization, devops, the Python ecosystem, and periodic reviews..Copyright © 2020 IDG Communications, Inc.",

        "Bridging the Cultural & Communication Gap.These are the phrases that you hear more and more these days as both Python and JavaScript have consistently remained at the top of the most popular programming languages in the last few years.. (Source: .).So which of the two programming languages is going to rule in the coming years?.When it comes to software development, there are only a handful of languages that can be used almost anywhere, be it web development, mobile application development, IoT software development, or AI & ML solution development..Python and JavaScript (with the support of Node.js) are the ones that fall under this category..According to ., JavaScript has retained its position at the top of the most commonly used programming languages..However, the popularity of Python has risen by leaps and bounds, overtaking languages such as Java, C#, PHP, and C++. Its fast-growth clearly threatens to dethrone JavaScript..However, the popularity of Python has risen by leaps and bounds, in a way that it has become the most wanted language among software developers – its rapid growth clearly threatens to dethrone JavaScript..We can say that the battle is neck-to-neck..Tell us your requirements. Our experts can help..To understand which language will rule in the coming years, we need to go through several parameters of both the languages while comparing them..The tools present on the user’s device play an integral role when it comes to frontend development, particularly the web browser. Moreover, browsers can only process JavaScript code..Talking about Python, there are ways to run its code in the browser which involves a Python interpreter written in JavaScript. For example, PyPy and CPython..However, it is not wise to replace languages which are frontend by nature – even if you utilize Python interpreter, the interpretation of code makes the execution process slower..In 2009, a new technology made its debut the vast universe of backend development. . was the first sincere attempt to pull JavaScript on the server-side, i.e. a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code on the server-side..It has evolved to become an advanced backend technology which comes with fewer dependencies and is very simple to learn..If we compare Python with Node.js, the latter one is best suited for smaller projects, runs faster, and offers scalability while the former is suited for a wide range of projects (from numerical computations, ., to network programming and AI & ML), is easy to learn, and is awesome at error handling (also takes less time to fix bugs)..Data science has quickly moved from experimental to applied technology, and the level of its adoption is growing rapidly..While implementing a data science project, a few substantial factors come into play..Let’s check out some of the best factors of JavaScript and Python that make them a preferable choice for a data science solution..JavaScript stands out for it data visualization. Libraries like D3.js, Chart.js, Plotly.js and many more make it a powerful data visualization and dashboard development technology.. Libraries like Tensorflow.js, Brain.js, machinlearn.js, math.js, and more bring ML to JavaScript developers – these libraries help them carry out complex matrix manipulations and increase the speed and efficiency of project execution.. Organizations are increasingly utilizing web technologies backed by Node-based stack to build their custom product. If data scientists have good grip over JavaScript, they can seamlessly communicate with product developers and build the product.. ETL stands for extract, transform, load which are the three fundamental functions of database management. Node.js, because of its asynchronous nature, is commonly used in ETL applications. Databases with hundreds of rows can be quickly processed with non-blocking calls over Node.js. This decreases waiting time and increases processing efficiency.. A decent library ecosystem is one of the main reasons why Python is the most preferred language for data science projects. Python libraries offer developers with all the basic items so that they don’t have to code everything from the scratch. For e.g., Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Keras, and PyBrain.. As mentioned above, Python supports a variety of pre-built libraries. Some of them act as visualization tools. With this, developers have the opportunity to represent data through histograms and charts. This is easily comprehensible to the non-technical people.. Coding with Python is super easy to learn and implement. Building data science solutions involve complex algorithms and versatile workflows, where Python’s simplicity allows developers to write reliable codes.. It is often helpful to process large data sets or run simulations in parallel. Python supports multi-threading which makes the data science job pretty easy..Talk with one of our expert Python developers..Performance is the most critical element of any programming language. This is because it directly impacts the speed of the application which is dependent on how fast the code is getting executed..Comparing Node.JS, a giant ecosystem of JavaScript, and Python performance wise, it’s clear that the former one is significantly faster. This is because it uses the Google V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, which is a super-fast and dynamic engine..Moreover, with its high performance and speed, Node.js is a perfect solution for applications featuring real-time messaging or chatting, as well as for heavy-weight applications, content management platforms, multi-vendor marketplaces, e-commerce solutions, and more largely depending on the speed of processing..Python is a programming language that is mostly the beginner’s choice, especially for those who don’t have a programming background..Several factors that make Python a user-friendly language are:.In comparison to Python, JavaScript is complicated and here’s why:.We have gone through the 5 most crucial factors which will determine the future of any programming language – ., and ...While Python beats JavaScript at data science and user-friendliness, JavaScript surpasses Python in frontend development and performance..We can conclude that both of these languages will rule in the coming years, but in their respective fields – Python will dominate the machine learning, data science, and neural networks world, while JavaScript will take over the web development world featuring real-time applications.. .Get in touch with one of our software development experts..

        "Hi! I'm currently studying . for mobile apps, but I also have a demand to automate some tasks on the web and create backends' for my apps, so thinking about which one of those could be better? Considering the performance and how easy it's to learn and create stuff? (I'm already familiar with . stack but want something more \"simple\" to write).Definitely Python. Lots of libraries, dead simple syntax. Lots of code examples and reference projects. Elixir is pure functional and takes time to grasp the concepts. Go is great, with simple syntax and performant runtime, but more strict as it is statically typed. For quick coding, nothing beats Python. As you come from .net I’d consider similar approach and be considering Java with SpringBoot as it makes Java faster and much more fun to code web servers.Elixir really has a good performance for the web (and in general).\nIts framework Phoenix for the web is a great tool, easy to install and to use, with features for websockets (and Pub/Sub) or LiveView to write reactive and real time app with only HTML (and Elixir) so basically everything is in one place.It can take some time to learn a few things in Elixir but I really think it's worth it, and it's very easy to go distributed and concurrent with Elixir. Also it's easier to code quickly with some features like the pattern matching or some operators like the pipe or the capture one.And in the case you need it you can still connect and interface Python and Elixir pretty quickly, and now Elixir has a lot of different frameworks : web, embedded or even neural networks now.Never went far with Go but I have some trouble with its syntax, I find it a bit messy.I don't have a lot of experience with the web with Python but I don't have a good experience with the little I did.Hey Vitor, You can use Node and Express JS to create a backend for your app. You can create REST APIS to connect your front end with the backend. It is a very simple and scalable solution for building backend web apps. .Judging your previous experience we will benefit from Golang in terms of portability and speed. If you want to go simplier use Python. If it's only scripts use Python..What stack is a cryptocurrency exchange built upon? For example let's see Binance's page of BTC/USDT market. The order data refreshes in milliseconds, graphs refreshes in milliseconds, orders are placed in ms and everything moves well dynamically. How are they able to achieve it? What front-end framework might they be using? What backend framework for this kind of data, framework for matching engine, database for such heavy loads?.For such a more realtime-focused, data-centered application like an exchange, it's not the frontend or backend that matter much. In fact for that, they can do away with any of the popular frameworks like React/Vue/Angular for the frontend and Go/Python for the backend. For example uniswap's frontend (although much simpler than binance) is built in React. The main interesting part here would be how they are able to handle updating data so quickly. In my opinion,  they might be heavily reliant on realtime processing systems like Kafka+Kafka Streams, Apache Flink or Apache Spark Stream or similar. For more processing heavy but not so real-time processing, they might be relying on OLAP and/or warehousing tools like Cassandra/Redshift. They could have also optimized few high frequent queries using NoSQL stores like mongodb (for persistance) and in-memory cache like Redis (for further perfomance boost to get millisecond latencies)..While these tools are a great start, you are going to need low latency, and extremely high bandwidth. I couldn't see this happening without you having pretty much your own datacenter at your disposal. While the post below gives some great options, it's extremely apache-biased. Not saying apache is bad, but there are other options to explore. My recommendation is a mix of services from AWS, azure.. Whatever cloud service you choose to go with. You'll definitely need a streaming service.. Either self-built or cloud provided, and a restful API for things that don't quite require the power of a stream. Then, as you scale, you'll start to realize that even the best stacks in the world have bottlenecks, and you'll want to employ use of some type of messaging queue..I'm making my university community web service with a team. (6 members myself included) .And we decided to use ., HTML, CSS (for sure, it's the basic of websites) but couldn't decide for the back end part. .There are tons of languages, tools, etc., but I'm really new to programming, so I'd like to get some help to figure out what tools we need. .So my question is this: are there any good examples of web community services we can mimic the tools or get an insight from them? .Since you're following Python, I would recomend using Django as your main back-end language. If you know Python it would be a great experience.\nDjango is well documented on their official website:\n.\nI would also use React for front-end as well. \nAlso this article is worth reading, I think progressive web app is something worth learning these days:\n.\nHope that helps :).Since your team is already using JavaScript, there's a great number of examples for backend services written with NodeJS. I'd recommend using Firebase, or any backend as a service (you can use that term to find alternatives), for setting up your backend as it is much easier for newer people to understand and lets you focus on your core application logic, and not provisioning servers, databases, etc..Since you're team is already using JavaScript, there are alot of examples and open source projects written with NodeJs, so I preffer this language in your backend application and also I am recommended using Mongo DB with It for saving data in it, and also for your frontend application I am recommanded using VueJs..Since you are already using JavaScript on the front end it would be easy to adopt the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack which s all javascript based making it easy to transfer knowledge with the backend and front end.Make it simple, most of projects doesnt need a AI, ML or big algorithms.\nIf your project just serving end users take it to the web ready compatible. (Javascript, .Net, PHP Laravel).Kindly I don't find any help that solve this mystery I need more help if it will happen.Hello, I am interested in learning how to program. I am a beginner, and  many articles saying I should go with . if I am new to programming. I considered . a long time ago, but for my career, I believe major programming languages should be better for me. I'm considering Python at this moment, but if you have other tools I should use, let me know..The language you choose is also dependant on the type of career / area of programming you wish to focus on: Web Based and mobile applicaitons I would lean towards Java,  PC Applications I tend to like C#, \n Embedded industry C, C++.my advice , you should answer me for this question, what do you like to work: web base or mobile native or cross platform. if you like web base you should choose PHP or ASP.net or Node.js or if you like mobile native you should decide Android or IOS platform and else if you like cross platfrom you should learn Flutter with dart language.\nthanks.Hi there. I'm looking to build an employee time tracker web app. This should also be optimized for mobile. I'm trying to figure out what the best stack is for this. I have knowledge of ., ., some .. I don't mind learning a new language for this purpose. Any help or advice would be really awesome! Thanks..Hi Otensia! I'd definitely recommend using the skills you've already got and building with . is a smart way to go these days. Most platform services have JavaScript/Node SDKs or NPM packages, many serverless platforms support Node in case you need to write any backend logic, and JavaScript is incredibly popular - meaning it will be easy to hire for, should you ever need to..My advice would be \".\". If you already have a skill set that will work well to solve the problem at hand, and you don't need it for any other projects, don't spend the time jumping into a new language. If you're looking for an excuse to learn something new, it would be better to invest that time in learning a new platform/tool that compliments your knowledge of JavaScript. For this project, I might recommend using ., ., or Google . to quickly and easily deploy your web app. If you need to add user authentication, there are great examples out there for ., ., or even . (a newcomer on the Auth scene, but very user friendly). All of these services work very well with a JavaScript-based application..As you have knowledge of Javascript, I would go towards Vue/React in Frontend and Node (with suitable framework) with backend. From my point of view Java would be too bloated for suggested kind of an app. I myself use PHP as a backend a lot and React as frontend but moving thoughts towards full stack javascript world..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..php is the best for beginners, and one of the best for web development at all, all the host servers can handle it, a basic knowledge in java is not enough for build a web site, but a basic knowledge in php is enough. learn php basics and oop and mvc design pattern or any framework like Laravel (optional), and javascript for frontend (a framework like React or Angular is optional but good) and you will build any web site you want..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..For just a time tracker app? I'd recommend going with a cloud-based approach. A couple serverless functions in whatever language you choose, and the front end can be a static website hosted inside a storage service (blob for Azure, bucket for AWS, etc). This will ultimately probably save you a little time, and them a little money on hosting..Hey, 👋 .My name is Brayden. I’m currently a Frontend . Developer, striving to move into Fullstack so I can expand my knowledge. .For my main backend language, I am deciding between .. I’ve tried each of them out for about an hour and currently, I like Python and Rust the most. However, I’m not sure if I’m missing out on something!.If anyone has advice on these technologies, I’d love to hear it!.Thanks. .Rust is still in low demand. It's a great language but you'll have a hard time finding jobs. Go is the mix of both Rust and Python. Great language with modern features, fast, scalable, fun to write, and at the same time it has high demand (not as much as python)..Python on the other hand is a language that you can't go wrong with. Look around you and see what your job market prefers. If there isn't much difference to you personally, pick the one with more demand..All of these are solid options, however considering your expertise currently, I would probably suggest Node.JS considering your past experience with JS. However Python offers a similar development environment to JS in my opinion, and Go is a good sort of intermediate between Rust and Node.JS and Python. It's fast, but not as fast as Rust, and offers a development experience that combines C-styled languages (like Rust), and Python-y languages... So: Rust for the fastest, Node for familiarity, Python for ease of development, and Go for a good middle ground. I have used all in personal projects... If you use Go, I suggest a easy to use web server framework like Fiber..Rust is a challenging choice, but worth to be chosen. It has strong memory-safety and type-safety, this gives you no bother about those errors. However, static typing languages often slow our developing speed down in early stage. In that case, it's effective to write prototype in an easy language like Python, and rewrite it in a hard language. It's important not to be afraid to throw away first code you write..The other answers are excellent, but I want to be a bit of a contrarian and say you should learn Rust. While the number of jobs for it are (relatively) low(er), it is certainly expanding and you'd be surprised at which companies do use Rust (Discord, for example, is starting to move away from Golang to Rust!). .But the main reason is that learning Rust itself will teach you a lot about systems design (/backend) because of its borrow checker. You can try out a lot of ideas and make a lot mistakes and the borrow checker will always be there guide you to a better solution (thereby teaching you in the process). .Also, I wouldn't underestimated how important managing memory (and memory safety) is. While Golang is great in some ways, it doesn't protect you from pushing memory leaks into production. And eventually you'll come upon a scenario where you'll have to make your Python code run faster and the optimizations you'd have to do won't look pretty (or be very Pythontic). .And Rust is freakin fast! If you have Rust, you wouldn't need any other language for the backend (or any other systems level code). Check this blog post: .. Discord found that even after spending months optimizing Golang code it still wasn't fast enough. But unoptimized, first-draft Rust code was (is) faster by an order of magnitude! .Hi.I want to build a tool to check asset availability (video, images, etc.) from third-party vendors. These vendors have APIs. However, this process should run daily basis and update the database with the status. This is a kind of separate process. I need to know what will be the good approach and technology for this?.hi - I think this depends on how you want to provide the information to the user. \nIf you want to build a Wordpress-plugin: PHP\nIf you want to build your own website: Python+Django / PHP / JavaScript+Node.js\nAs Desktop application?.for what technologies you should use, this is depend on what technology do you prefer? your should think best structuing for your code because each API vendor has different to a nother one so it's better no merege code vendores  together.\nyour code must be using SOLID principle pattern and some design pattern such as Factory Pattern.The major advantage of Go is that you can run queries in parallel. Fire off a Go thread for each vendor and each thread can check the availability of assets from a specific vendor and update the database. Go supports hundreds of threads with ease..Hi, I would recommend Go because of strongly-typed nature which makes a developer more productive as it is less error prone compared to the other dynamic-typed language. Go also has cron-job library(powered by goroutines) that can help with your automated tasks..your decision depend on what language do you know. if you know php you can use laravel framework.I am technical support. I work daily with . / Exchange, Active directory. I would like to learn scripting and automation to make my life easier. I just started learning . but not really sure about the correct study path from where I can start. I am taking some courses on Udemy and YouTube. Is it enough? .My first foray into programming was with powershell and it continues to be an enormous help for me in my career (caveat being that I have primarily worked on windows boxes). That being said, PowerShell is a weird language that has some unique syntax and operators that don't translate well to other languages.  Python is weird too, but for other reasons (spacing!). I suspect you'll get more immediate benefit spending some time on Powershell since your working in an environment that fully supports the ps toolset. .As for learning, I read \"PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches\" and found that helpful. However, I think your course of study is sufficient.  Think the most return for the effort was just messing around in the powershell IDE on my local computer and working the Microsoft documentation. .Taking courses on Udemy and YouTube will be helpful I'm sure, but don't neglect the power of practice. If you work largely with Windows right now, pick powershell. Take opportunities to convert the knowledge you already have (example: unlocking an account in Active Directory or adding an email alias in Exchange) from a manual process to a powershell method. Sometimes that's a single cmdlet (Unlock-AdAccount) and sometimes it's a script..Once you have a good understanding of variables, the pipeline, and foreach loops, you'll be in a position to accelerate your learning. Looking up Microsoft docs is part of the process :).I would consider reading \"Powershell for sysadmins\" from No Starch Press. Start small with the ActiveDirectory and AzureAd modules. Start with read only operations like pulling AD Group Members into a variable and then pipe that variable into a .csv file with Export-CSV cmdlet. Once you feel more comfortable with the syntax, specific cmdlets, and piping data start looking at specific techniques like using hashtables (dictionaries) and globbing. From there you can begin to construct your own functions and modules. Just start small and don't let yourself get overwhelmed. .Hi Everyone,.I have some experience working with . and . and will now try to learn . - could you please share some similarities and differences between JS and C# and what rookie mistakes I should watch out for when learning C#?.Also, any tips & good practices are greatly appreciated :).Thank you .If you want to learn . to write some backend code you can also check out . which is basically JavaScript running outside the browser. You can create any kind of web servers, APIs, scrapers, automation scripts, etc using all the same JavaScript..A good entry to . is .. It is the most common web framework for .. It's well documented and there are a lot of educational materials for it..I prefer functional programming because it produces less buggy code (thus I recommend .), and is simply better to learn this paradigm earlier on in your coding career rather than later. It can also do most stuff . can do, namely code with .. If you're going to learn . then you should learn .+. first though before doing web development with ./.C# is .net framework of a programming language specially different from the programming languages you're used to. If you learn C# you will be experienceed in coding with VIsual Basic .net and also creating web development using ASP and this ASP also include JavaScript function.... I urge you to learn it.I think you can manage to find something about this topic. it's pretty popular one.\nex: .Something I don't see discussed enough over the internet is the performance difference. I don't think you should worry about this. 95% of the time you won't notice the difference on your day to day projets. You will know what you need in terms of performance when you get there..I am a beginner, and I am totally confused, which of these 3 languages to learn first. \n., ., or .. As my studies are going which of them will be easy to learn with studies that is, I can learn and do my studies also. Which one of them will be easily handled with my studies, and will be much much useful in future?.python is a good language to start for the beginner..Python is a great language to learn as a beginner. However, Go is really easy to learn as well and has a much more powerful standard library that will allow you to build very complex and powerful applications in the future. Go is becoming a standard in Cloud computing and concurrency. Both of which are very advanced but important. .I'd definitely start with Go. I know Python, Go and quite a few other languages..Rust is not easy to learn as a beginner..Python has way too many features to be called \"easy\" to learn. While it is very forgiving to beginner mistakes it feels like playing in a puddle of mud. It does not teach you clean programming at all. Unless of course you like messy..Go on the other hand is very easy to learn. As a professional you can learn the entire language in under 2 hours. I have already given the tour of Go (.) to complete beginners and they went through it very thoroughly and thereby knew the entire Go language in less than 5 days. While it is very easy to learn and very easy to read, it is quite strict on other things, guiding you to write clean code. For one it is a typed language and it is good to learn very early about types..Knowing the entire language is of course not all there is to know. There is the standard library and a lot of other libraries to get to know in every language. Also one has to learn patterns in every language, get experience on how to structure code, dig deeper into the language itself to understand its inner workings, etc. That takes years in every language..That being said, it depends very much on what you want to do with a language. If you want to go into ML and science you definitely need Python. If you want to go into cloud computing, distributed servers (which in my opinion any server should be nowadays), use Go. If you want to do systems level programming, e.g in hardware programming, use Rust..I have experience in all three languages, and you should learn python first. These are three different languages (read: tools) to solve different problems you may have. \nPython is a high level language you can use for writing cross-platform scripts, web servers, AI, websites (e.g. Django) and the list goes on. Python can be used for most programming tasks while being the easiest to learn of the three and probably the most productive as well. .A lot of tech companies start out with Python for their web services, but due to Pythons slow speed and the pain that comes with dynamically typed languages when the code base grows, switch to Go later on when they need to scale. Go is a systems language that thrives when used for high performance cloud/web or networking services. Go is used in performance critical networking situations such as Twitch's streaming services and Uber's geofence services. It's also very clean and simple syntax that makes it very easy to quickly understand what code does..Python is an interpreted language and Go is a garbage collected language, but Rust is a highly performant and reliable compiled programming language without the extra baggage of runtime memory management. Rust forces you to follow coding patterns that assure memory safety. This makes Rust a perfect fit for high performance algorithms, game engines or safety-critical systems, but would be overkill for web servers or scripts on modern hardware..If all you want is a gentle intro and have access to tools and libs that can help with your tasks, Python is the way to go. It's ecosystem is huge and the language is easy to pick up. However, if you are aiming to get into software industry, I'd highly recommend you also pick up another classic language like C++/C#/Java. It really helps you cement some CS & programming fundamentals and get more familiar with the concept of software design and software architecture. Not saying you cannot achieve good architecture in Python or Go, but traditionally you have more materials covering these classic OOP languages. And once you learn them, you can apply your knowledge to other languages and it helps you understand other languages faster..Rust is probably a bad choice for starting out. It is a low level language where garbage collection is not done automatically, and has to get you thinking about all the technical aspects. It is statically typed and compiled, so it's very strict with how you code.\n I do love Rust though, it's a nice language.\nGolang is also compiled and statically typed, but it aims to be for quick development, which makes it a better choice for starting out..Python though can be great for starting out and getting a hold on how to program. You don't need to worry about things such as types, garbage collection, or an overwhelming amount of data types. \nSince I'm a JavaScript fanboy I can't help but say another great popular choice to start is JavaScript 😁.If you start learning programming I'd suggest Python language. I have no experience with Go and Rust so I cannot give you advice for them..Python has the broadest reach as it's been around the longest; rust is much more difficult for a beginner to learn; I work with Go every day and it's probably the most productive general use language..Learn/start with C; don't rush after buzz words. Python is easy to learn but you would not get the underpinnings of memory and pointers, an important aspect of programming. .I'd choose python because with a good knowledge of python and it's libraries, you could do literally anything. Also it has a relatively simple structure, so it won't be tough for a beginner. .Later on if you wish to learn Rust and Go, please do by all means..Study, machine learning = Python |\nHigh performance computing, safety-oriented programming = Rust |\nBackend, feel productive with less runtime performance drawback = Go.Go and Python are going to be much easier to learn than Rust. The memory management for Rust is pretty hard to wrap your head around when you are first learning how to do basic things with the language. Get familiar with programming first, then learn Rust. .I agree with most of the other answers here. Python is the best choice because it is super user-friendly, has an easy syntax, and can do many complex things in relatively fewer lines. .While Rust is a more recent and a great language nonetheless, it is slightly more complicated as it involves compiling and the syntax isn't so great. .And Go is the not a great choice either. While it has a decent syntax, keep in mind that Go won't be of much use unless you plan on working in Google. Even if you want to learn it, you can do so later..I hope this helped you in making your decision, and welcome to the world of programming! I hope you enjoy..Python is the easiest of the languages to learn, and while the slowest in production, it will teach many of the basic fundamental concepts of programming, especially if you're not going to be doing anything low level or at a system level..Python is a great language to start programming with, there is an awesome python course on coursera by Dr. Charles Severance called Programming for everybody, check it out :).Python, because its the easiest to learn as a beginer. Its often called \"English without grammar\" because its terms and writing style is quite similar to English. Python also has a diverse range of applications like Web App, Desktop App, Data Science etc.Python is the best programming language for starting out as it is quite easy to learn, but it also is very powerful and you can do plenty with it. It will be useful for a long time. Python is my recommendation..Python will be used in order to train machine learning models from our data.  We chose python for this task because it is the most common language for machine learning.  It has very performant libraries like numpy and scikit-learn that provide functionality for manipulating data and creating models that you cannot get in other languages like JavaScript and Java.  Additionally, it is the most familiar language for us to use for machine learning because almost every machine learning course teaches ml using python..Javascript will be used for both our frontend and backend on the web service.  JavaScript is ubiquitous as the language to use for the frontend.  For the backend, we decided to create our server using JavaScript because of its easy setup; using Express we can create a server in just a few short lines of code.  It is simple not only to run the server locally, but to host it as well because any major service will support the language.  JavaScript is a simple language to code in and familiar among our team members, so using it will help speed up development.  Using JavaScript allows us to use NodeJS and npm, so we can use packages to easily set up the server, connect to a database and other convenient utilities.  We also considered Python for our server.  It is also very simple to create a server in Python, especially using flask.  However, the extra familiarity with the JavaScript language and the ease of using packages were enough for us to pick JavaScript as our language of choice.. .Python is the default go-to for machine learning. It has a wide variety of useful packages such as pandas and numpy to aid with ML, as well as deep-learning frameworks. Furthermore, it is more production-friendly compared to other ML languages such as R..Pytorch is a deep-learning framework that is both flexible and fast compared to Tensorflow + Keras. It is also well documented and has a large community to answer lingering questions. .Python: The top language in machine learning area because of the various open-source libraries.

So a hybrid application approach is the best because it allows you to develop a cross-platform application in a unique codebase. \nThe choice behind Ionic is Angular, I think that angular is the best framework to develop a complex application that needs a lot of service interaction, its modularity forces you (the developer) to write the code in the correct way, so it can be maintainable and reusable..I had a . to create the simplest accounting software for Mac and Windows to help small businesses in Canada..This led me to a long 2 years of exploration of the best language that could provide these features:.I tried Python, Java, C# and C++ without finding what I was looking for..When I discovered Javascript, I really knew it was the right language to use. Thinking of this today makes me realize even more how great a decision this has been to learn, use and master Javascript. It has been a fun, challenging and productive road on which I am still satisfied. .Obviously, when I refer to Javascript, it is not without implying the vast ecosystem around it. For me, JS is a whole universe in which almost every imaginable tools exist. It's awesome - for real. Thanks to all the contributors which have made it possible. .To be even clearer about how intense I am with Javascript, let's just say that my first passion was music. Until, I find coding with Javascript! Yep, I know!.So in conclusion, I chose Javascript because it is versatile, enjoyable, widely used, productive for both desktop softwares and websites with ability to create modern great looking user interfaces (assuming HTML and CSS are involved) and finally there are job openings..Simple Customer Registration Crud, with the functions of Register, Delete, Edit and List new and old customers registered in the Database. PostgreSQL was used as DBMS, due to its easy use and practicality..Crud de Cadastro a Clientes simples, com as funções de Registrar, Deletar, Editar e Listar novos e antigos clientes cadastrado no Banco de Dados. Foi utilizado como SGBD o PostgreSQL, pelo seu facil uso e praticidade..Python has become the most popular language for machine learning right now since almost all machine learning tools provide service for this language, and it is really to use since it has many build-in objects like Hashtable. In C, you need to implement everything by yourself. .C++ is one of the most popular programming languages in graphics. It has many fancy libraries like eigen to help us process matrix. I have many previous projects about graphics based on C++ and this time, we also need to deal with graphics since we need to analyze movements of the human body. C++ has much more advantages than Java. C++ uses only compiler, whereas Java uses compiler and interpreter in both. C++ supports both operator overloading and method overloading whereas Java only supports method overloading. C++ supports manual object management with the help of new and delete keywords whereas Java has built-in automatic garbage collection..Pinterest.WorkOS.Pinterest.Rancher Labs.Pinterest.Red Hat, Inc..LogRocket.CloudSponge",
        "Hi! I'm currently studying . for mobile apps, but I also have a demand to automate some tasks on the web and create backends' for my apps, so thinking about which one of those could be better? Considering the performance and how easy it's to learn and create stuff? (I'm already familiar with . stack but want something more \"simple\" to write).Definitely Python. Lots of libraries, dead simple syntax. Lots of code examples and reference projects. Elixir is pure functional and takes time to grasp the concepts. Go is great, with simple syntax and performant runtime, but more strict as it is statically typed. For quick coding, nothing beats Python. As you come from .net I’d consider similar approach and be considering Java with SpringBoot as it makes Java faster and much more fun to code web servers.Elixir really has a good performance for the web (and in general).\nIts framework Phoenix for the web is a great tool, easy to install and to use, with features for websockets (and Pub/Sub) or LiveView to write reactive and real time app with only HTML (and Elixir) so basically everything is in one place.It can take some time to learn a few things in Elixir but I really think it's worth it, and it's very easy to go distributed and concurrent with Elixir. Also it's easier to code quickly with some features like the pattern matching or some operators like the pipe or the capture one.And in the case you need it you can still connect and interface Python and Elixir pretty quickly, and now Elixir has a lot of different frameworks : web, embedded or even neural networks now.Never went far with Go but I have some trouble with its syntax, I find it a bit messy.I don't have a lot of experience with the web with Python but I don't have a good experience with the little I did.Hey Vitor, You can use Node and Express JS to create a backend for your app. You can create REST APIS to connect your front end with the backend. It is a very simple and scalable solution for building backend web apps. .Judging your previous experience we will benefit from Golang in terms of portability and speed. If you want to go simplier use Python. If it's only scripts use Python..What stack is a cryptocurrency exchange built upon? For example let's see Binance's page of BTC/USDT market. The order data refreshes in milliseconds, graphs refreshes in milliseconds, orders are placed in ms and everything moves well dynamically. How are they able to achieve it? What front-end framework might they be using? What backend framework for this kind of data, framework for matching engine, database for such heavy loads?.For such a more realtime-focused, data-centered application like an exchange, it's not the frontend or backend that matter much. In fact for that, they can do away with any of the popular frameworks like React/Vue/Angular for the frontend and Go/Python for the backend. For example uniswap's frontend (although much simpler than binance) is built in React. The main interesting part here would be how they are able to handle updating data so quickly. In my opinion,  they might be heavily reliant on realtime processing systems like Kafka+Kafka Streams, Apache Flink or Apache Spark Stream or similar. For more processing heavy but not so real-time processing, they might be relying on OLAP and/or warehousing tools like Cassandra/Redshift. They could have also optimized few high frequent queries using NoSQL stores like mongodb (for persistance) and in-memory cache like Redis (for further perfomance boost to get millisecond latencies)..While these tools are a great start, you are going to need low latency, and extremely high bandwidth. I couldn't see this happening without you having pretty much your own datacenter at your disposal. While the post below gives some great options, it's extremely apache-biased. Not saying apache is bad, but there are other options to explore. My recommendation is a mix of services from AWS, azure.. Whatever cloud service you choose to go with. You'll definitely need a streaming service.. Either self-built or cloud provided, and a restful API for things that don't quite require the power of a stream. Then, as you scale, you'll start to realize that even the best stacks in the world have bottlenecks, and you'll want to employ use of some type of messaging queue..I'm making my university community web service with a team. (6 members myself included) .And we decided to use ., HTML, CSS (for sure, it's the basic of websites) but couldn't decide for the back end part. .There are tons of languages, tools, etc., but I'm really new to programming, so I'd like to get some help to figure out what tools we need. .So my question is this: are there any good examples of web community services we can mimic the tools or get an insight from them? .Since you're following Python, I would recomend using Django as your main back-end language. If you know Python it would be a great experience.\nDjango is well documented on their official website:\n.\nI would also use React for front-end as well. \nAlso this article is worth reading, I think progressive web app is something worth learning these days:\n.\nHope that helps :).Since your team is already using JavaScript, there's a great number of examples for backend services written with NodeJS. I'd recommend using Firebase, or any backend as a service (you can use that term to find alternatives), for setting up your backend as it is much easier for newer people to understand and lets you focus on your core application logic, and not provisioning servers, databases, etc..Since you're team is already using JavaScript, there are alot of examples and open source projects written with NodeJs, so I preffer this language in your backend application and also I am recommended using Mongo DB with It for saving data in it, and also for your frontend application I am recommanded using VueJs..Since you are already using JavaScript on the front end it would be easy to adopt the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack which s all javascript based making it easy to transfer knowledge with the backend and front end.Make it simple, most of projects doesnt need a AI, ML or big algorithms.\nIf your project just serving end users take it to the web ready compatible. (Javascript, .Net, PHP Laravel).Kindly I don't find any help that solve this mystery I need more help if it will happen.Hello, I am interested in learning how to program. I am a beginner, and  many articles saying I should go with . if I am new to programming. I considered . a long time ago, but for my career, I believe major programming languages should be better for me. I'm considering Python at this moment, but if you have other tools I should use, let me know..The language you choose is also dependant on the type of career / area of programming you wish to focus on: Web Based and mobile applicaitons I would lean towards Java,  PC Applications I tend to like C#, \n Embedded industry C, C++.my advice , you should answer me for this question, what do you like to work: web base or mobile native or cross platform. if you like web base you should choose PHP or ASP.net or Node.js or if you like mobile native you should decide Android or IOS platform and else if you like cross platfrom you should learn Flutter with dart language.\nthanks.Hi there. I'm looking to build an employee time tracker web app. This should also be optimized for mobile. I'm trying to figure out what the best stack is for this. I have knowledge of ., ., some .. I don't mind learning a new language for this purpose. Any help or advice would be really awesome! Thanks..Hi Otensia! I'd definitely recommend using the skills you've already got and building with . is a smart way to go these days. Most platform services have JavaScript/Node SDKs or NPM packages, many serverless platforms support Node in case you need to write any backend logic, and JavaScript is incredibly popular - meaning it will be easy to hire for, should you ever need to..My advice would be \".\". If you already have a skill set that will work well to solve the problem at hand, and you don't need it for any other projects, don't spend the time jumping into a new language. If you're looking for an excuse to learn something new, it would be better to invest that time in learning a new platform/tool that compliments your knowledge of JavaScript. For this project, I might recommend using ., ., or Google . to quickly and easily deploy your web app. If you need to add user authentication, there are great examples out there for ., ., or even . (a newcomer on the Auth scene, but very user friendly). All of these services work very well with a JavaScript-based application..As you have knowledge of Javascript, I would go towards Vue/React in Frontend and Node (with suitable framework) with backend. From my point of view Java would be too bloated for suggested kind of an app. I myself use PHP as a backend a lot and React as frontend but moving thoughts towards full stack javascript world..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..php is the best for beginners, and one of the best for web development at all, all the host servers can handle it, a basic knowledge in java is not enough for build a web site, but a basic knowledge in php is enough. learn php basics and oop and mvc design pattern or any framework like Laravel (optional), and javascript for frontend (a framework like React or Angular is optional but good) and you will build any web site you want..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..For just a time tracker app? I'd recommend going with a cloud-based approach. A couple serverless functions in whatever language you choose, and the front end can be a static website hosted inside a storage service (blob for Azure, bucket for AWS, etc). This will ultimately probably save you a little time, and them a little money on hosting..Hey, 👋 .My name is Brayden. I’m currently a Frontend . Developer, striving to move into Fullstack so I can expand my knowledge. .For my main backend language, I am deciding between .. I’ve tried each of them out for about an hour and currently, I like Python and Rust the most. However, I’m not sure if I’m missing out on something!.If anyone has advice on these technologies, I’d love to hear it!.Thanks. .Rust is still in low demand. It's a great language but you'll have a hard time finding jobs. Go is the mix of both Rust and Python. Great language with modern features, fast, scalable, fun to write, and at the same time it has high demand (not as much as python)..Python on the other hand is a language that you can't go wrong with. Look around you and see what your job market prefers. If there isn't much difference to you personally, pick the one with more demand..All of these are solid options, however considering your expertise currently, I would probably suggest Node.JS considering your past experience with JS. However Python offers a similar development environment to JS in my opinion, and Go is a good sort of intermediate between Rust and Node.JS and Python. It's fast, but not as fast as Rust, and offers a development experience that combines C-styled languages (like Rust), and Python-y languages... So: Rust for the fastest, Node for familiarity, Python for ease of development, and Go for a good middle ground. I have used all in personal projects... If you use Go, I suggest a easy to use web server framework like Fiber..Rust is a challenging choice, but worth to be chosen.

You can try out a lot of ideas and make a lot mistakes and the borrow checker will always be there guide you to a better solution (thereby teaching you in the process). .Also, I wouldn't underestimated how important managing memory (and memory safety) is. While Golang is great in some ways, it doesn't protect you from pushing memory leaks into production. And eventually you'll come upon a scenario where you'll have to make your Python code run faster and the optimizations you'd have to do won't look pretty (or be very Pythontic). .And Rust is freakin fast! If you have Rust, you wouldn't need any other language for the backend (or any other systems level code). Check this blog post: .. Discord found that even after spending months optimizing Golang code it still wasn't fast enough. But unoptimized, first-draft Rust code was (is) faster by an order of magnitude! .Hi.I want to build a tool to check asset availability (video, images, etc.) from third-party vendors. These vendors have APIs. However, this process should run daily basis and update the database with the status. This is a kind of separate process. I need to know what will be the good approach and technology for this?.hi - I think this depends on how you want to provide the information to the user. \nIf you want to build a Wordpress-plugin: PHP\nIf you want to build your own website: Python+Django / PHP / JavaScript+Node.js\nAs Desktop application?.for what technologies you should use, this is depend on what technology do you prefer? your should think best structuing for your code because each API vendor has different to a nother one so it's better no merege code vendores  together.\nyour code must be using SOLID principle pattern and some design pattern such as Factory Pattern.The major advantage of Go is that you can run queries in parallel. Fire off a Go thread for each vendor and each thread can check the availability of assets from a specific vendor and update the database. Go supports hundreds of threads with ease..Hi, I would recommend Go because of strongly-typed nature which makes a developer more productive as it is less error prone compared to the other dynamic-typed language. Go also has cron-job library(powered by goroutines) that can help with your automated tasks..your decision depend on what language do you know. if you know php you can use laravel framework.I am technical support. I work daily with . / Exchange, Active directory. I would like to learn scripting and automation to make my life easier. I just started learning . but not really sure about the correct study path from where I can start. I am taking some courses on Udemy and YouTube. Is it enough? .My first foray into programming was with powershell and it continues to be an enormous help for me in my career (caveat being that I have primarily worked on windows boxes). That being said, PowerShell is a weird language that has some unique syntax and operators that don't translate well to other languages.  Python is weird too, but for other reasons (spacing!). I suspect you'll get more immediate benefit spending some time on Powershell since your working in an environment that fully supports the ps toolset. .As for learning, I read \"PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches\" and found that helpful. However, I think your course of study is sufficient.  Think the most return for the effort was just messing around in the powershell IDE on my local computer and working the Microsoft documentation. .Taking courses on Udemy and YouTube will be helpful I'm sure, but don't neglect the power of practice. If you work largely with Windows right now, pick powershell. Take opportunities to convert the knowledge you already have (example: unlocking an account in Active Directory or adding an email alias in Exchange) from a manual process to a powershell method. Sometimes that's a single cmdlet (Unlock-AdAccount) and sometimes it's a script..Once you have a good understanding of variables, the pipeline, and foreach loops, you'll be in a position to accelerate your learning. Looking up Microsoft docs is part of the process :).I would consider reading \"Powershell for sysadmins\" from No Starch Press. Start small with the ActiveDirectory and AzureAd modules. Start with read only operations like pulling AD Group Members into a variable and then pipe that variable into a .csv file with Export-CSV cmdlet. Once you feel more comfortable with the syntax, specific cmdlets, and piping data start looking at specific techniques like using hashtables (dictionaries) and globbing. From there you can begin to construct your own functions and modules. Just start small and don't let yourself get overwhelmed. .Hi Everyone,.I have some experience working with . and . and will now try to learn . - could you please share some similarities and differences between JS and C# and what rookie mistakes I should watch out for when learning C#?.Also, any tips & good practices are greatly appreciated :).Thank you .If you want to learn . to write some backend code you can also check out . which is basically JavaScript running outside the browser. You can create any kind of web servers, APIs, scrapers, automation scripts, etc using all the same JavaScript..A good entry to . is .. It is the most common web framework for .. It's well documented and there are a lot of educational materials for it..I prefer functional programming because it produces less buggy code (thus I recommend .), and is simply better to learn this paradigm earlier on in your coding career rather than later. It can also do most stuff . can do, namely code with .. If you're going to learn . then you should learn .+. first though before doing web development with ./.C# is .net framework of a programming language specially different from the programming languages you're used to. If you learn C# you will be experienceed in coding with VIsual Basic .net and also creating web development using ASP and this ASP also include JavaScript function.... I urge you to learn it.I think you can manage to find something about this topic. it's pretty popular one.\nex: .Something I don't see discussed enough over the internet is the performance difference. I don't think you should worry about this. 95% of the time you won't notice the difference on your day to day projets. You will know what you need in terms of performance when you get there..I am a beginner, and I am totally confused, which of these 3 languages to learn first. \n., ., or .. As my studies are going which of them will be easy to learn with studies that is, I can learn and do my studies also. Which one of them will be easily handled with my studies, and will be much much useful in future?.python is a good language to start for the beginner..Python is a great language to learn as a beginner. However, Go is really easy to learn as well and has a much more powerful standard library that will allow you to build very complex and powerful applications in the future. Go is becoming a standard in Cloud computing and concurrency. Both of which are very advanced but important. .I'd definitely start with Go. I know Python, Go and quite a few other languages..Rust is not easy to learn as a beginner..Python has way too many features to be called \"easy\" to learn. While it is very forgiving to beginner mistakes it feels like playing in a puddle of mud. It does not teach you clean programming at all. Unless of course you like messy..Go on the other hand is very easy to learn. As a professional you can learn the entire language in under 2 hours. I have already given the tour of Go (.) to complete beginners and they went through it very thoroughly and thereby knew the entire Go language in less than 5 days. While it is very easy to learn and very easy to read, it is quite strict on other things, guiding you to write clean code. For one it is a typed language and it is good to learn very early about types..Knowing the entire language is of course not all there is to know. There is the standard library and a lot of other libraries to get to know in every language. Also one has to learn patterns in every language, get experience on how to structure code, dig deeper into the language itself to understand its inner workings, etc. That takes years in every language..That being said, it depends very much on what you want to do with a language. If you want to go into ML and science you definitely need Python. If you want to go into cloud computing, distributed servers (which in my opinion any server should be nowadays), use Go. If you want to do systems level programming, e.g in hardware programming, use Rust..I have experience in all three languages, and you should learn python first. These are three different languages (read: tools) to solve different problems you may have. \nPython is a high level language you can use for writing cross-platform scripts, web servers, AI, websites (e.g. Django) and the list goes on. Python can be used for most programming tasks while being the easiest to learn of the three and probably the most productive as well. .A lot of tech companies start out with Python for their web services, but due to Pythons slow speed and the pain that comes with dynamically typed languages when the code base grows, switch to Go later on when they need to scale. Go is a systems language that thrives when used for high performance cloud/web or networking services. Go is used in performance critical networking situations such as Twitch's streaming services and Uber's geofence services. It's also very clean and simple syntax that makes it very easy to quickly understand what code does..Python is an interpreted language and Go is a garbage collected language, but Rust is a highly performant and reliable compiled programming language without the extra baggage of runtime memory management. Rust forces you to follow coding patterns that assure memory safety. This makes Rust a perfect fit for high performance algorithms, game engines or safety-critical systems, but would be overkill for web servers or scripts on modern hardware..If all you want is a gentle intro and have access to tools and libs that can help with your tasks, Python is the way to go. It's ecosystem is huge and the language is easy to pick up. However, if you are aiming to get into software industry, I'd highly recommend you also pick up another classic language like C++/C#/Java. It really helps you cement some CS & programming fundamentals and get more familiar with the concept of software design and software architecture. Not saying you cannot achieve good architecture in Python or Go, but traditionally you have more materials covering these classic OOP languages. And once you learn them, you can apply your knowledge to other languages and it helps you understand other languages faster..Rust is probably a bad choice for starting out. It is a low level language where garbage collection is not done automatically, and has to get you thinking about all the technical aspects. It is statically typed and compiled, so it's very strict with how you code.\n I do love Rust though, it's a nice language.\nGolang is also compiled and statically typed, but it aims to be for quick development, which makes it a better choice for starting out..Python though can be great for starting out and getting a hold on how to program. You don't need to worry about things such as types, garbage collection, or an overwhelming amount of data types. \nSince I'm a JavaScript fanboy I can't help but say another great popular choice to start is JavaScript 😁.If you start learning programming I'd suggest Python language. I have no experience with Go and Rust so I cannot give you advice for them..Python has the broadest reach as it's been around the longest; rust is much more difficult for a beginner to learn; I work with Go every day and it's probably the most productive general use language..Learn/start with C; don't rush after buzz words. Python is easy to learn but you would not get the underpinnings of memory and pointers, an important aspect of programming. .I'd choose python because with a good knowledge of python and it's libraries, you could do literally anything. Also it has a relatively simple structure, so it won't be tough for a beginner. .Later on if you wish to learn Rust and Go, please do by all means..Study, machine learning = Python |\nHigh performance computing, safety-oriented programming = Rust |\nBackend, feel productive with less runtime performance drawback = Go.Go and Python are going to be much easier to learn than Rust. The memory management for Rust is pretty hard to wrap your head around when you are first learning how to do basic things with the language. Get familiar with programming first, then learn Rust. .I agree with most of the other answers here. Python is the best choice because it is super user-friendly, has an easy syntax, and can do many complex things in relatively fewer lines. .While Rust is a more recent and a great language nonetheless, it is slightly more complicated as it involves compiling and the syntax isn't so great. .And Go is the not a great choice either. While it has a decent syntax, keep in mind that Go won't be of much use unless you plan on working in Google. Even if you want to learn it, you can do so later..I hope this helped you in making your decision, and welcome to the world of programming! I hope you enjoy..Python is the easiest of the languages to learn, and while the slowest in production, it will teach many of the basic fundamental concepts of programming, especially if you're not going to be doing anything low level or at a system level..Python is a great language to start programming with, there is an awesome python course on coursera by Dr. Charles Severance called Programming for everybody, check it out :).Python, because its the easiest to learn as a beginer. Its often called \"English without grammar\" because its terms and writing style is quite similar to English. Python also has a diverse range of applications like Web App, Desktop App, Data Science etc.Python is the best programming language for starting out as it is quite easy to learn, but it also is very powerful and you can do plenty with it. It will be useful for a long time. Python is my recommendation..Python will be used in order to train machine learning models from our data.  We chose python for this task because it is the most common language for machine learning.  It has very performant libraries like numpy and scikit-learn that provide functionality for manipulating data and creating models that you cannot get in other languages like JavaScript and Java.  Additionally, it is the most familiar language for us to use for machine learning because almost every machine learning course teaches ml using python..Javascript will be used for both our frontend and backend on the web service.  JavaScript is ubiquitous as the language to use for the frontend.  For the backend, we decided to create our server using JavaScript because of its easy setup; using Express we can create a server in just a few short lines of code.  It is simple not only to run the server locally, but to host it as well because any major service will support the language.  JavaScript is a simple language to code in and familiar among our team members, so using it will help speed up development.  Using JavaScript allows us to use NodeJS and npm, so we can use packages to easily set up the server, connect to a database and other convenient utilities.  We also considered Python for our server.  It is also very simple to create a server in Python, especially using flask.  However, the extra familiarity with the JavaScript language and the ease of using packages were enough for us to pick JavaScript as our language of choice.. .Python is the default go-to for machine learning. It has a wide variety of useful packages such as pandas and numpy to aid with ML, as well as deep-learning frameworks. Furthermore, it is more production-friendly compared to other ML languages such as R..Pytorch is a deep-learning framework that is both flexible and fast compared to Tensorflow + Keras. It is also well documented and has a large community to answer lingering questions. .Python: The top language in machine learning area because of the various open-source libraries.

So a hybrid application approach is the best because it allows you to develop a cross-platform application in a unique codebase. \nThe choice behind Ionic is Angular, I think that angular is the best framework to develop a complex application that needs a lot of service interaction, its modularity forces you (the developer) to write the code in the correct way, so it can be maintainable and reusable..I had a . to create the simplest accounting software for Mac and Windows to help small businesses in Canada..This led me to a long 2 years of exploration of the best language that could provide these features:.I tried Python, Java, C# and C++ without finding what I was looking for..When I discovered Javascript, I really knew it was the right language to use. Thinking of this today makes me realize even more how great a decision this has been to learn, use and master Javascript. It has been a fun, challenging and productive road on which I am still satisfied. .Obviously, when I refer to Javascript, it is not without implying the vast ecosystem around it. For me, JS is a whole universe in which almost every imaginable tools exist. It's awesome - for real. Thanks to all the contributors which have made it possible. .To be even clearer about how intense I am with Javascript, let's just say that my first passion was music. Until, I find coding with Javascript! Yep, I know!.So in conclusion, I chose Javascript because it is versatile, enjoyable, widely used, productive for both desktop softwares and websites with ability to create modern great looking user interfaces (assuming HTML and CSS are involved) and finally there are job openings..Simple Customer Registration Crud, with the functions of Register, Delete, Edit and List new and old customers registered in the Database. PostgreSQL was used as DBMS, due to its easy use and practicality..Crud de Cadastro a Clientes simples, com as funções de Registrar, Deletar, Editar e Listar novos e antigos clientes cadastrado no Banco de Dados. Foi utilizado como SGBD o PostgreSQL, pelo seu facil uso e praticidade..Python has become the most popular language for machine learning right now since almost all machine learning tools provide service for this language, and it is really to use since it has many build-in objects like Hashtable. In C, you need to implement everything by yourself. .C++ is one of the most popular programming languages in graphics. It has many fancy libraries like eigen to help us process matrix. I have many previous projects about graphics based on C++ and this time, we also need to deal with graphics since we need to analyze movements of the human body. C++ has much more advantages than Java. C++ uses only compiler, whereas Java uses compiler and interpreter in both. C++ supports both operator overloading and method overloading whereas Java only supports method overloading. C++ supports manual object management with the help of new and delete keywords whereas Java has built-in automatic garbage collection..Pinterest.WorkOS.Pinterest.Rancher Labs.Pinterest.Red Hat, Inc..LogRocket.CloudSponge",
        "Hello everyone! I’m interested in learning AI development, and after doing a little bit of research, I’ve learned that . and . are the top languages for AI. Which one should I learn? What are the differences? Are they hard to learn? If anyone can help with this, it’d be very appreciated. Thank you!.Java is far more popular and you can use other JVM-based languages such as Kotlin (I would recommend Kotlin over Java). Also, for Java, there are many more libraries, tools, etc. Also, if you learn Java, you can do almost anything - mobile (Android), web, and desktop apps - without \"hacks\". There is native support for all of these..As with any programming language, it's not hard to learn the syntax but it's hard to understand the ecosystem, know libraries, best practices, etc. From that point of view, I would also prefer java - more tools, more libraries, more resources, guides, how-tos, etc. .Hi\nExcuse me if I wrote the text badly because I do not know much English\nMy suggestion is to choose Python for artificial intelligence because it has both comfortable and powerful syntax.\nPython is currently the best language for artificial intelligence\nIt is better to go and learn Python and then learn one of the artificial intelligence frameworks and enter it..I'd recommend Python due to the fact that many AI libraries and frameworks are specifically developed for the Python ecosystem. .Java is good for general purpose programming: Web, Mobile and Desktop, however doesn't really have many native libraries supporting AI Development..As for LISP, again it has some support,, however Python seems to be the leading edge in AI development.I have not much idea about Lisp, but have been a Java professional since last 20 odd years. And I would say Java along with Python is one of the best languages for AI..AI works on the concept of algorithms, and Java is algorithm based. Also Java has it's own AI libraries that can be reused. You have Java AI libraries for Expert Systems, Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing..Also Java being a widely used language, brings with it certain advantages, ease of usage, debugging, has a large user base and support groups. And above all JVM helps you to create on single app, that can run on any platform. And it's features of garbage collection, simplifying work with large scale projects makes it better..Hope this helps..Hi! I'm currently studying . for mobile apps, but I also have a demand to automate some tasks on the web and create backends' for my apps, so thinking about which one of those could be better? Considering the performance and how easy it's to learn and create stuff? (I'm already familiar with . stack but want something more \"simple\" to write).Definitely Python. Lots of libraries, dead simple syntax. Lots of code examples and reference projects. Elixir is pure functional and takes time to grasp the concepts. Go is great, with simple syntax and performant runtime, but more strict as it is statically typed. For quick coding, nothing beats Python. As you come from .net I’d consider similar approach and be considering Java with SpringBoot as it makes Java faster and much more fun to code web servers.Elixir really has a good performance for the web (and in general).\nIts framework Phoenix for the web is a great tool, easy to install and to use, with features for websockets (and Pub/Sub) or LiveView to write reactive and real time app with only HTML (and Elixir) so basically everything is in one place.It can take some time to learn a few things in Elixir but I really think it's worth it, and it's very easy to go distributed and concurrent with Elixir. Also it's easier to code quickly with some features like the pattern matching or some operators like the pipe or the capture one.And in the case you need it you can still connect and interface Python and Elixir pretty quickly, and now Elixir has a lot of different frameworks : web, embedded or even neural networks now.Never went far with Go but I have some trouble with its syntax, I find it a bit messy.I don't have a lot of experience with the web with Python but I don't have a good experience with the little I did.Hey Vitor, You can use Node and Express JS to create a backend for your app. You can create REST APIS to connect your front end with the backend. It is a very simple and scalable solution for building backend web apps. .Judging your previous experience we will benefit from Golang in terms of portability and speed. If you want to go simplier use Python. If it's only scripts use Python..What stack is a cryptocurrency exchange built upon? For example let's see Binance's page of BTC/USDT market. The order data refreshes in milliseconds, graphs refreshes in milliseconds, orders are placed in ms and everything moves well dynamically. How are they able to achieve it? What front-end framework might they be using? What backend framework for this kind of data, framework for matching engine, database for such heavy loads?.For such a more realtime-focused, data-centered application like an exchange, it's not the frontend or backend that matter much. In fact for that, they can do away with any of the popular frameworks like React/Vue/Angular for the frontend and Go/Python for the backend. For example uniswap's frontend (although much simpler than binance) is built in React. The main interesting part here would be how they are able to handle updating data so quickly. In my opinion,  they might be heavily reliant on realtime processing systems like Kafka+Kafka Streams, Apache Flink or Apache Spark Stream or similar. For more processing heavy but not so real-time processing, they might be relying on OLAP and/or warehousing tools like Cassandra/Redshift. They could have also optimized few high frequent queries using NoSQL stores like mongodb (for persistance) and in-memory cache like Redis (for further perfomance boost to get millisecond latencies)..While these tools are a great start, you are going to need low latency, and extremely high bandwidth. I couldn't see this happening without you having pretty much your own datacenter at your disposal. While the post below gives some great options, it's extremely apache-biased. Not saying apache is bad, but there are other options to explore. My recommendation is a mix of services from AWS, azure.. Whatever cloud service you choose to go with. You'll definitely need a streaming service.. Either self-built or cloud provided, and a restful API for things that don't quite require the power of a stream. Then, as you scale, you'll start to realize that even the best stacks in the world have bottlenecks, and you'll want to employ use of some type of messaging queue..I'm making my university community web service with a team. (6 members myself included) .And we decided to use ., HTML, CSS (for sure, it's the basic of websites) but couldn't decide for the back end part. .There are tons of languages, tools, etc., but I'm really new to programming, so I'd like to get some help to figure out what tools we need. .So my question is this: are there any good examples of web community services we can mimic the tools or get an insight from them? .Since you're following Python, I would recomend using Django as your main back-end language. If you know Python it would be a great experience.\nDjango is well documented on their official website:\n.\nI would also use React for front-end as well. \nAlso this article is worth reading, I think progressive web app is something worth learning these days:\n.\nHope that helps :).Since your team is already using JavaScript, there's a great number of examples for backend services written with NodeJS. I'd recommend using Firebase, or any backend as a service (you can use that term to find alternatives), for setting up your backend as it is much easier for newer people to understand and lets you focus on your core application logic, and not provisioning servers, databases, etc..Since you're team is already using JavaScript, there are alot of examples and open source projects written with NodeJs, so I preffer this language in your backend application and also I am recommended using Mongo DB with It for saving data in it, and also for your frontend application I am recommanded using VueJs..Since you are already using JavaScript on the front end it would be easy to adopt the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack which s all javascript based making it easy to transfer knowledge with the backend and front end.Make it simple, most of projects doesnt need a AI, ML or big algorithms.\nIf your project just serving end users take it to the web ready compatible. (Javascript, .Net, PHP Laravel).Kindly I don't find any help that solve this mystery I need more help if it will happen.Hello, I am interested in learning how to program. I am a beginner, and  many articles saying I should go with . if I am new to programming. I considered . a long time ago, but for my career, I believe major programming languages should be better for me. I'm considering Python at this moment, but if you have other tools I should use, let me know..The language you choose is also dependant on the type of career / area of programming you wish to focus on: Web Based and mobile applicaitons I would lean towards Java,  PC Applications I tend to like C#, \n Embedded industry C, C++.my advice , you should answer me for this question, what do you like to work: web base or mobile native or cross platform. if you like web base you should choose PHP or ASP.net or Node.js or if you like mobile native you should decide Android or IOS platform and else if you like cross platfrom you should learn Flutter with dart language.\nthanks.Hi there. I'm looking to build an employee time tracker web app. This should also be optimized for mobile. I'm trying to figure out what the best stack is for this. I have knowledge of ., ., some .. I don't mind learning a new language for this purpose. Any help or advice would be really awesome! Thanks..Hi Otensia! I'd definitely recommend using the skills you've already got and building with . is a smart way to go these days. Most platform services have JavaScript/Node SDKs or NPM packages, many serverless platforms support Node in case you need to write any backend logic, and JavaScript is incredibly popular - meaning it will be easy to hire for, should you ever need to..My advice would be \".\". If you already have a skill set that will work well to solve the problem at hand, and you don't need it for any other projects, don't spend the time jumping into a new language. If you're looking for an excuse to learn something new, it would be better to invest that time in learning a new platform/tool that compliments your knowledge of JavaScript. For this project, I might recommend using ., ., or Google . to quickly and easily deploy your web app. If you need to add user authentication, there are great examples out there for ., ., or even . (a newcomer on the Auth scene, but very user friendly). All of these services work very well with a JavaScript-based application..As you have knowledge of Javascript, I would go towards Vue/React in Frontend and Node (with suitable framework) with backend. From my point of view Java would be too bloated for suggested kind of an app. I myself use PHP as a backend a lot and React as frontend but moving thoughts towards full stack javascript world..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..php is the best for beginners, and one of the best for web development at all, all the host servers can handle it, a basic knowledge in java is not enough for build a web site, but a basic knowledge in php is enough. learn php basics and oop and mvc design pattern or any framework like Laravel (optional), and javascript for frontend (a framework like React or Angular is optional but good) and you will build any web site you want..We migrated from PHP to Angular/PHP to Angular/Node to React/Node/AWS Lambda. React/Node(Typescript)/Lambda seems to be good so far as we have developed few applications (large and small) using this stack so far. React/Node/Lambda is also good for mobile. If you are planning to use AWS, you can use the S3 bucket to store the frontend and Lambda or EC2 for backend APIs..For just a time tracker app? I'd recommend going with a cloud-based approach. A couple serverless functions in whatever language you choose, and the front end can be a static website hosted inside a storage service (blob for Azure, bucket for AWS, etc). This will ultimately probably save you a little time, and them a little money on hosting..Hey, 👋 .My name is Brayden. I’m currently a Frontend . Developer, striving to move into Fullstack so I can expand my knowledge. .For my main backend language, I am deciding between .. I’ve tried each of them out for about an hour and currently, I like Python and Rust the most. However, I’m not sure if I’m missing out on something!.If anyone has advice on these technologies, I’d love to hear it!.Thanks. .Rust is still in low demand. It's a great language but you'll have a hard time finding jobs. Go is the mix of both Rust and Python. Great language with modern features, fast, scalable, fun to write, and at the same time it has high demand (not as much as python)..Python on the other hand is a language that you can't go wrong with. Look around you and see what your job market prefers. If there isn't much difference to you personally, pick the one with more demand..All of these are solid options, however considering your expertise currently, I would probably suggest Node.JS considering your past experience with JS. However Python offers a similar development environment to JS in my opinion, and Go is a good sort of intermediate between Rust and Node.JS and Python. It's fast, but not as fast as Rust, and offers a development experience that combines C-styled languages (like Rust), and Python-y languages... So: Rust for the fastest, Node for familiarity, Python for ease of development, and Go for a good middle ground. I have used all in personal projects... If you use Go, I suggest a easy to use web server framework like Fiber..Rust is a challenging choice, but worth to be chosen. It has strong memory-safety and type-safety, this gives you no bother about those errors. However, static typing languages often slow our developing speed down in early stage. In that case, it's effective to write prototype in an easy language like Python, and rewrite it in a hard language. It's important not to be afraid to throw away first code you write..The other answers are excellent, but I want to be a bit of a contrarian and say you should learn Rust. While the number of jobs for it are (relatively) low(er), it is certainly expanding and you'd be surprised at which companies do use Rust (Discord, for example, is starting to move away from Golang to Rust!). .But the main reason is that learning Rust itself will teach you a lot about systems design (/backend) because of its borrow checker. You can try out a lot of ideas and make a lot mistakes and the borrow checker will always be there guide you to a better solution (thereby teaching you in the process). .Also, I wouldn't underestimated how important managing memory (and memory safety) is. While Golang is great in some ways, it doesn't protect you from pushing memory leaks into production. And eventually you'll come upon a scenario where you'll have to make your Python code run faster and the optimizations you'd have to do won't look pretty (or be very Pythontic). .And Rust is freakin fast! If you have Rust, you wouldn't need any other language for the backend (or any other systems level code). Check this blog post: .. Discord found that even after spending months optimizing Golang code it still wasn't fast enough. But unoptimized, first-draft Rust code was (is) faster by an order of magnitude! .Hi.I want to build a tool to check asset availability (video, images, etc.) from third-party vendors. These vendors have APIs. However, this process should run daily basis and update the database with the status. This is a kind of separate process. I need to know what will be the good approach and technology for this?.hi - I think this depends on how you want to provide the information to the user. \nIf you want to build a Wordpress-plugin: PHP\nIf you want to build your own website: Python+Django / PHP / JavaScript+Node.js\nAs Desktop application?.for what technologies you should use, this is depend on what technology do you prefer? your should think best structuing for your code because each API vendor has different to a nother one so it's better no merege code vendores  together.\nyour code must be using SOLID principle pattern and some design pattern such as Factory Pattern.The major advantage of Go is that you can run queries in parallel. Fire off a Go thread for each vendor and each thread can check the availability of assets from a specific vendor and update the database. Go supports hundreds of threads with ease..Hi, I would recommend Go because of strongly-typed nature which makes a developer more productive as it is less error prone compared to the other dynamic-typed language. Go also has cron-job library(powered by goroutines) that can help with your automated tasks..your decision depend on what language do you know. if you know php you can use laravel framework.I was thinking about adding a new technology to my current stack (. and .). But, I want a compiled language, mainly for speed and scalability reasons compared to interpreted languages. I have tried each one (., ., and .). I loved them, and I don't know which one can offer me more opportunities for the future (I'm in my first year of software engineering at university)..Which language should I choose?.I will highly recommend Kotlin.\nI have worked with all three intensely and so far the development speed and simplicity is the best with Kotlin.\nKotlin supports . out of the box. Now, it isn't something that can't be implemented in other languages but Kotlin makes it super easy to work with them.\nKotlin has a bit of learning curve, so, by the time you can actually use it idiomatically chances are that you will get proficient in Java too. But once you get it, you get it, then there is no other language ;)\nKotlin is backed by Google and Jetbrains team so you can expect latest programming features and good community support..As you certainly know, there are languages that compile in meta-code for Virtual Machines (Java, C#, Kotlin) and languages that compile in Machine Language (Go, Rust). Apart specific domains (blockchain, IoT embedded software, AI, cloud) almost no-one uses languages that compile in machine language, for a series of reason, most of all security and portability. So, if you are going to learn for business go with Kotlin - Java is a bit ancien regime.\nIf you seriously need to learn a language that compiles in ML - for example you will code for IoT - go with Go - or Rust - but keep in mind that Rust is much less used than Go.\nPS: Kotlin also compiles in ML, but I would choose a language designed for that, instead of one that compiles \"also\" in ML.\nPPS: Some Virtual Machines - ie: GraalVM - allow you to compile Java in ML. The world of IT is beautiful..I'd say Rust's knowledge will be more valuable in comparison. You can work in Blockchain development,  compile to WASM (WebAssembly). There is a new JavaScript/TypeScript runtime named Deno (by the creator of Node.js) that has its backend in Rust. .It depends on which level and use cases you prefer to work at. Close to the machine? Rust is great but if you need to find more job opportunities, then take C/C++. Java has many job positions but I suggest Kotlin over it. Think about it as a better Java, but fewer job positions.\nDo you want to do your own projects? So a productive language like Ruby is way better. Like to program front-end apps? Take JS.\nFind your passion..If you want a compiled language then go for Rust. It takes a certain mindset to get your head around its memory management system and the way it handles \"borrowed\" memory. However, it will generate blindingly fast code that you can cross-compile for other platforms. As a systems programming language I highly recommend it. Take time and learn it. .Java is only compiled to bytecode, not to machine code. So it executes in the Java Virtual Machine. DOn't think that its not fast, because the latest incarnation are very fast indeed. For most practical purposes, users of your code won't notice any difference. There are a heck of a lot of features in Java that you either have to import via crates in Rust, or write yoursef. So productivity-wise, Java may well beat Rust. .Kotlin is a Java-lookalike. It's a nice, and succinct version of Java and is totally interoperable. But its a bit niche, and for me it fails because my dev environment of choice (Spring Tool Suite) doesn't really play well with Kotlin. To use it you would be well advised to use iDeaj. I have used kotlin, and I like it, but not enough to ditch all my Java code. .Other contenders, depending on your platform of choice are Golang,  C, C++, and C# (available as Mono on Linux systems).  .I use Rust and Java and if you need a compiled language I recommend Rust. .I'd recommend you to take a look at Java and Kotlin, the first due to the number of companies that actively use it in your products. Kotlin is gaining adept since it is fully compatibly with the Java ecosystem but usually requires less code to do the same (ignoring other benefits of the language). Another benefits of the Kotlin is that it is in fact multiplatform, where you could use the same syntax to code for mobile, web and backend applications.\nThe drawback of Kotlin, is the number of open jobs that exists currently compared to Java, but I pretty sure that it will change in the near future..All those are nice languages, but Rust is harder to learn properly and has a smaller ecosystem. If you want to work in system programming (like hardware drivers) Rust is probably your choice. Otherwise, Java/Kotlin ecosystem is much larger and gives much more possibilities (maybe excluding low-level system programming). .When talking about Kotlin and Java, both are good. But Kotlin, again, gives much more opportunities. Kotlin-JS gives you browser applications, Kotlin-Native allows to compile to native application (and interop with them). Kotlin-WASM will be available shortly. Rust is better than Kotlin-Native for native development tight now, but not by far and it makes sense only if you are focusing only on native development..I would go with Kotlin. It is pretty hyped currently..You can use Kotlin for a lot of application types. To name some:.The code is also really concise, readable and modern. It also provides many features that you will find in many other programming languages. .I am technical support. I work daily with . / Exchange, Active directory. I would like to learn scripting and automation to make my life easier. I just started learning . but not really sure about the correct study path from where I can start. I am taking some courses on Udemy and YouTube. Is it enough? .My first foray into programming was with powershell and it continues to be an enormous help for me in my career (caveat being that I have primarily worked on windows boxes). That being said, PowerShell is a weird language that has some unique syntax and operators that don't translate well to other languages.  Python is weird too, but for other reasons (spacing!). I suspect you'll get more immediate benefit spending some time on Powershell since your working in an environment that fully supports the ps toolset. .As for learning, I read \"PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches\" and found that helpful. However, I think your course of study is sufficient.  Think the most return for the effort was just messing around in the powershell IDE on my local computer and working the Microsoft documentation. .Taking courses on Udemy and YouTube will be helpful I'm sure, but don't neglect the power of practice. If you work largely with Windows right now, pick powershell. Take opportunities to convert the knowledge you already have (example: unlocking an account in Active Directory or adding an email alias in Exchange) from a manual process to a powershell method. Sometimes that's a single cmdlet (Unlock-AdAccount) and sometimes it's a script..Once you have a good understanding of variables, the pipeline, and foreach loops, you'll be in a position to accelerate your learning. Looking up Microsoft docs is part of the process :).I would consider reading \"Powershell for sysadmins\" from No Starch Press. Start small with the ActiveDirectory and AzureAd modules. Start with read only operations like pulling AD Group Members into a variable and then pipe that variable into a .csv file with Export-CSV cmdlet. Once you feel more comfortable with the syntax, specific cmdlets, and piping data start looking at specific techniques like using hashtables (dictionaries) and globbing. From there you can begin to construct your own functions and modules. Just start small and don't let yourself get overwhelmed. .Python will be used in order to train machine learning models from our data.  We chose python for this task because it is the most common language for machine learning.  It has very performant libraries like numpy and scikit-learn that provide functionality for manipulating data and creating models that you cannot get in other languages like JavaScript and Java.  Additionally, it is the most familiar language for us to use for machine learning because almost every machine learning course teaches ml using python..Javascript will be used for both our frontend and backend on the web service.  JavaScript is ubiquitous as the language to use for the frontend.  For the backend, we decided to create our server using JavaScript because of its easy setup; using Express we can create a server in just a few short lines of code.  It is simple not only to run the server locally, but to host it as well because any major service will support the language.  JavaScript is a simple language to code in and familiar among our team members, so using it will help speed up development.  Using JavaScript allows us to use NodeJS and npm, so we can use packages to easily set up the server, connect to a database and other convenient utilities.  We also considered Python for our server.  It is also very simple to create a server in Python, especially using flask.  However, the extra familiarity with the JavaScript language and the ease of using packages were enough for us to pick JavaScript as our language of choice.. .Python is the default go-to for machine learning. It has a wide variety of useful packages such as pandas and numpy to aid with ML, as well as deep-learning frameworks. Furthermore, it is more production-friendly compared to other ML languages such as R..Pytorch is a deep-learning framework that is both flexible and fast compared to Tensorflow + Keras. It is also well documented and has a large community to answer lingering questions. .Python: The top language in machine learning area because of the various open-source libraries.

So a hybrid application approach is the best because it allows you to develop a cross-platform application in a unique codebase. \nThe choice behind Ionic is Angular, I think that angular is the best framework to develop a complex application that needs a lot of service interaction, its modularity forces you (the developer) to write the code in the correct way, so it can be maintainable and reusable..Expo was a tool Macombey really wanted to utilize from the beginning. I have been working with React Native since 2016 and originally I had to use simulators in Xcode, install pods on top of node packages, configure certificates, and more abundant objectives that take time away from actual development. As a development studio, we have to move quick and get projects to our clients and partners in a matter of months..Expo made this easy for us. We now have a mobile app for clients to download and test their project on, there is no need to install pods or configure Xcode, and development is super fast and reliable now..I had a . to create the simplest accounting software for Mac and Windows to help small businesses in Canada..This led me to a long 2 years of exploration of the best language that could provide these features:.I tried Python, Java, C# and C++ without finding what I was looking for..When I discovered Javascript, I really knew it was the right language to use. Thinking of this today makes me realize even more how great a decision this has been to learn, use and master Javascript. It has been a fun, challenging and productive road on which I am still satisfied. .Obviously, when I refer to Javascript, it is not without implying the vast ecosystem around it. For me, JS is a whole universe in which almost every imaginable tools exist. It's awesome - for real. Thanks to all the contributors which have made it possible. .To be even clearer about how intense I am with Javascript, let's just say that my first passion was music. Until, I find coding with Javascript! Yep, I know!.So in conclusion, I chose Javascript because it is versatile, enjoyable, widely used, productive for both desktop softwares and websites with ability to create modern great looking user interfaces (assuming HTML and CSS are involved) and finally there are job openings..Simple Customer Registration Crud, with the functions of Register, Delete, Edit and List new and old customers registered in the Database.

        "\n            Ever wondered how to send data between two programming languages? Ever tried to send an object or multiple pieces of data?\n    .\n            Today I'll be showing you how to use JSON to send data from JavaScript to Python. I'll be covering how to setup a web server, along with all the code you need.\n    .\n            You will need a few things to get started with this project. I'll be running on Mac, which has Python installed already. You should be able to follow along reasonably well using Linux. If you are using Windows, you will need to . and install Python, and maybe brush up on your ..\n    .\n            You will need ., a package manager for Python. This is installed by default with Python versions greater than 2.7.9.\n    .\n            You need a server to . Python to a web page. There are many options for this. If you have a server setup already, you can skip this step.\n    .\n            There are many options you could use here. . is a good choice, as is . (I have written about Twisted before for a .). I'll be using . for this project.\n    .\n            Install Flask using pip (via the command line):\n    .\n            That's it! There are a few options to setup, but providing it installed correctly, you are good to go.\n    .\n            You may wish to consider using a ., however this is entirely optional.\n    .\n            Create a new file in your favorite text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE). I'm using . and ., but use whatever you are comfortable with.\n    .\n            Now perform some initial setup of Flask:\n    .\n            This imports the required modules and configures your app. Now set up a .:\n    .\n            This configures a ., which is like a page of a website. This may sometimes be called an . or a ..\n    .\n            The . line defines a . or . called ., which will run whenever this endpoint is called. These methods do not have to use the same name as the endpoint -- call it any suitable name. Inside this method is a simple . string. Finally, setup your script to actually run when it is requested:\n    .\n            Go ahead and save this script as . in a suitable location. Go back to your Terminal and navigate to your project folder. Run the script:\n    .\n            The word . is used to tell the computer that the following file should be run as a Python script. The filename afterwards is the name of the file you wish to run as Python. If everything works correctly, you should see a status message in the Terminal:\n    .\n            This shows you the IP address your server is running on, as well as the port. These will be . and .. You can press . > . to stop this running, but don't do that just yet.\n    .\n            Enter the address into your browser, and you should see . appear on the screen. You have now successfully setup a Python server and written your first script! You will need to restart the server (stop the script, then run it again) if you make any changes.\n    .\n            If you wish to view your scripts on a different computer on the same network, change . to:\n    .\n            There are two parts to this line. The first tells Flask to serve files on your local IP address (make sure you keep this as ., even though that is not your IP address). The second part specifies the port. You can change the port if you wish to. Run the script again (remember to save and restart).\n    .\n            You should now be able to access your scripts from a different computer on the same network. Make sure to use your IP address (run . in the command line) and the port you entered previously. You may need to configure your . if you are using one.\n    .\n            The console will show you the HTTP response, and IP address of any device that connects to your server:\n    .\n            Notice how the endpoint . returned a 404 error? The endpoint is not setup! If you wish to access this over the internet, look into ..\n    .\n            Now that your server is all setup, it's time to write some templates. You will use JSON to send data between Python and Javascript, and templates facilitate this. We have written about . in the past, so go read up if you are not sure.\n    .\n            You will need to use a templating language. . comes with Flask, so there is no extra setup needed.\n    .\n            A templating language works in conjunction with a web server. It takes the output of your Python scripts (the back-end code), and makes it easy to output to the user using HTML (the front-end). It's important to note that templates should . be used for logic! Keep the logic in Python, and use templates . for displaying the data. It gets very messy if you start trying to get complex with the template.\n    .\n            Create a folder inside your project directory called .. Flask recognizes files inside this folder as template files. Don't place any Python scripts in here, this is where you can put your HTML files.\n    .\n            Create a file called .. Inside it, place the following code:\n    .\n            This is the way to access a piece of data called ., which will be found inside your scripts. Go back to your .. script, and modify the . function. Instead of returning ., enter this code:\n    .\n            This will load the . file you created earlier, and substitute the . template tag for the string .. You can use this method to load any page inside your template folder, and pass them any amount of data.\n    .\n            Now that you know how templates work, here's the full HTML code you need. Paste this inside your . file:\n    .\n            Notice how this does not include CSS, or any HTML headers. These are required for webpages (this example will work without them), so look into these at . if you care to.\n    .\n            There is not too much going on in this file. A JSON list of rally cars is setup. There is a bit of text and a button. When the button is pressed, . is used to . the list of cars to the server. This will go to the . endpoint, which you will create next. Make sure you read our . if you want to learn more about how that is working in this context.\n    .\n            Here's the code you need for .:\n    .\n            This code defines two endpoints. The default one (.) serves the previous html page. When the button is pressed, a . request is made to the . endpoint. The second part of the route definition (.) defines how this page can be accessed. As . is the only way specified, this route will deny any other http requests (such as .).\n    .\n            This . endpoint simply loops over every JSON row, and appends the car make to a string, which then gets returned after the loop. The JSON is stored in the . variable, and as the . was used, Python is aware that this is a JSON object. The . variable inside the . can be thought of like a row of data. Different elements of each row can be accessed by using their name in square brackets (.).\n    .\n            Open your browser developer tools (. > . > . on Mac OS/Chrome), and navigate to the . tab. Press the button, and you should see the server response appear:\n    .\n            Try modifying the initial JSON and see what happens. Let's modify the Python to do . different, depending on the JSON. Here's the new code you need for the .:\n    .\n            This uses a simple if statement to change the output, depending on the input. You could easily adapt this to write to a database, or run a different piece of code. Here's what it looks like now:\n    .\n            You should now have a solid understanding of how to setup a Python server, and how you can respond to JSON requests.\n    .\n            Do you enjoy coding in JavaScript?

        "In the last few months, I've been trying to compare the languages that I've worked with so far. The reason being, I often find myself in situations when I have a task at hand, and I realize there are multiple different ways to do it in multiple languages, and I get analysis paralysis..Anyways, the focus of this post is Python, Javascript, and their use in Web automation. To be fair, both languages have different histories and evolved very differently, but web automation is one area that I feel where both languages have something to offer. I'll try to compare Python and Javascript in the context of different usage patterns and ways of performing web automation..I've seen a lot of beginners (including the early-me) misunderstanding the scope of web automation. I've got a couple of things to say here. Firstly,.Web scraping is one kind of web automation, but web automation is more generic than that..Secondly,.If you automate any manual task on the web, the process of doing it can be called as web automation..There are many that you can think of, but here are some of the popular ones,.Form filling, as the name suggests, means automating the manual interaction with forms on the web. This interaction could be entering text, selecting radio buttons, ticking checkboxes, etc. Why would you want to automate them? Well, there could be many reasons. For instance, I once automated the login process of my university's library portal to make a CLI utility that would do things like subscription-renew, check fines, etc. for lazy geeks (., don't judge me for the code, it was years ago). Another reason could be that a large part of the time in your job is spent on filling in redundant details in these redundant forms, so you may want to automate these workflows. Speaking of workflows,.This is my favorite use case for web automation. You can combine a bunch of automation pieces together to do things like,.Testing is a very popular use-case of web automation. It is almost a necessity when you have a large web application. As a developer, you'd like to write test cases for functional behavior of the web feature that you're developing, so that you can be assured that it is working as per specifications. This is also called \"Quality Assurance\" or (QA) in the formal world. And another thing that you'd like to have is to accumulate similar tests over the time in a test suite, so that every time you add a new feature, you are assured that its addition doesn't change any existing \"expected\" behavior in the bigger scheme of things. Loosely speaking, this process is known as regression testing, and if you simulate it for the entire user journey, you can call it end-to-end testing. Automation testing for a website attempts to prevent many embarrassing bugs like \"button not getting clicked,\" \"broken URLs\" (unless you want to show off your .), etc. by trying to simulate and test all the scenarios upfront exhaustively..Web scraping, in simple terms, is the act of extracting data from websites. The data can be used for several purposes. It's often a cat and mouse game between the website owner and the developer operating in a .. On one side, there are website owners who are putting fences around their content in the form of captchas, authorization-mechanisms, etc. and on the other side are developers who are coming up with ways to bypass these fences and extract the data they need from the website. There are different reasons that you might need to extract and organize data from other websites like doing some analysis or using it as an input for some business logic (ex. showcasing Amazon's price of some product on your site)..The crux of web-automation is that instead of humans, you figure out some way to let the computers do those repetitive and tedious tasks..Sidenote: Web automation (even when assisted by AI) is not equivalent to computers taking jobs; it's more like freeing humans to focus on more creative tasks (like automating more things)..So you may ask, what are the tools that people use (or have been using) to do web automation?.Well, the programmers have relied on simulating the web in their programs to achieve what they want. Typical series of steps are making requests to the server, parsing the response, making sure if the response is as expected (if testing is the purpose), otherwise taking actions based on the response, all via the program. There are now high-level libraries and frameworks available to ease-off programmer's life while writing these automation scripts. For example, . is quite a popular library for browser automation, supporting APIs for most of the popular languages..For non-technology-focused enterprises, there are companies like ., ., etc. that provide solutions to manage the entire data-extraction pipeline from the web. Some companies also want to understand the consumer sentiment on social media or understand the consumer sentiments of the competitors, and there are services that let you set such kind of a monitoring system in a few clicks..And for individuals who are not so code-friendly (and probably want to do automation for different reasons), there are SaaS solutions that let one create workflows. For example, check ., ., and . (If this, then that). Some of the workflows don't interact directly with web per se, rather they depend on REST APIs, but the end objective is still the same, automation! And not to mention, there are a LOT of companies whose lifeline is just web automation (consider product-and-price comparison services, or cross-browser testing solutions, for example)..Okay, the important question now, \"Given that I know either Python or Javascript, how do I go about doing web automation with them?\"..The motivation behind creating and using libraries is to minimize the boilerplate and not reinvent the wheel. Usually, the libraries that you'll use will provide with one or many of these functionalities,.For instance, . is widely used for handling HTTP requests in Python, and the analogous library in Javascript is .. Python has . for parsing and pulling data out of HTML and XML files, Javascript has .. Frameworks like . take scraping to another level (.). The closer alternatives that I'm aware of for Javascript are ... is a web automation framework. It can control the browser and thus can let you simulate user actions programmatically. Selenium is quite useful in the scenarios where the content that one wants to work on is either rendered at the browser side by libraries like . or ., or fetched by making future . calls to the server and then rendered by the browser. A couple of examples of this include:.These scenarios can only be handled if we are able to simulate browser like behavior (hence Selenium to the rescue). Selenium has client interfaces for most of the popular languages (including Python and Javascript, of course)..Usually, the triggering of the client program launches a browser instance, and we can see things like clicking and entering data on the screen, which is useful while testing. But if we care about just scraping, we can use \"headless browsers\" that don't have UI and are faster in terms of performance. . is a popular choice for a headless web driver, and other options include . and PhantomJS. You can download the latest versions of all of the Selenium components from ...The javascript testing ecosystem has a lot of tools that overlap with web-automation. I'm avoiding discussing them here because it's a subject of an entire post, but you can check . if you'd like to explore..There are some tools that you'll be using fairly often when you're doing web automation. Some of them are,.Okay, now it's time to compare these two languages face-to-face. For reference, I'll share snippets for solving captchas during web-automation using 2cpatcha service. You can read more about the process ...I've used the respective popular libraries (requests and axios) in both the languages mentioned previously for handling HTTP requests. The implementations are not equivalent line-to-line, but the gist is the same. Here are a few things that I've to say about both these languages,.This is a preferred-paradigm difference that you'll see in the Python and Javascript libraries. Javascript libraries lean towards the promise, and callback style programming, which means the code is more likely to be complex (check .), whereas Python libraries are synchronous. Of course, it is possible to follow both the paradigms in both the languages. But you can already see in the snippets that it is easier to follow along with the Python code than the JavaScript code (you can argue that JavaScript is not well written above, and that's the thing I want to stress on next. I find it slightly more difficult to understand and implement Javascript constructs)..I feel that the leniency in JavaScript demands great responsibility as a developer to get things done \"rightly.\" There are occasions where Python makes a stronger case for web-automation, simply because of the simplicity of the solution (can save development time). Things like immutable object types, strict argument matching for functions, strong typing, can prevent bugs (due to reasons like malformed input) from creeping into your automation pipeline. If you've worked with Javascript, you might be familiar with those annoying bugs due to things like \"undefined\" values, implicit typecasting, async related issues, etc. (check out .)..node.js beats CPython in terms of execution speed, and this has really been the major plus point of using node.js for web applications. The difference in performance ultimately boils down to design or the underlying runtime and libraries. The V8 engine is a Just-in-time compiler and is natively non-blocking. The popular libraries in the Javascript ecosystem have tried hard to take advantage of this design. Not to mention that V8 is maintained by Google (hence a lot of resources being poured into optimizing it)..Benchmarks can be subtle, so not including them in the post. But if you're interested in benchmarks, do check out ...A programming language has more to offer than just grammar and implementation. It has a community of developers, a mechanism to share and distribute code, a collection of reusable distributions, and much more..In this post, I tried to briefly touch on Python, JavaScript, and their differences in the context of Web automation. I hope that you got some useful information that might help you in picking a language among these two in future..Enjoy this post?

        "There are five primitive types in JavaScript.number.string.boolean.undefined.null.symbol (new).Lets look at a simple example that demonstrates some ideas with numbers..Next, lets look at the JavaScript equivalent..There are several new concepts introduced in this example. We will look\nat them in the following order:.Variable declaration and scope.Input/Output.JavaScript has three scopes – global, function, and block. Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope, and is therefore accessible from anywhere in your code. Each function has its own scope, and any variable declared, using ., within that function is only accessible from that function and any nested functions.   You can also declare a variable to be local to a block, such as inside a loop or an if statement using ..  If you think carefully about this you may realize that function scope is kind of redundant with block scope, after all a function defines its own block.  You would be right, but JavaScript has been changing and the introduction of . to create block level scope is pretty new.  In fact many programmers have hurt themselves over the years by assuming that JavaScript had block level scope when it actually did not.  Thankfully, those days are over provided you use the right syntax.  The best advice I have seen is to stop using . and just use . in your code..Both Python and JavaScript are . languages. In a\ndynamically typed language a variable can refer to any kind of object at\nany time. When the variable is used, the interpreter figures out what\nkind of object it is. However JavaScript allows you to declare a variable to determine its scope. Undeclared variables in JavaScript have global scope, which is definitely not what you usually want..In the example above, we show an old style declaration of the . variable.  This ensures that . is a local variable to the function.  The . declaration of the . makes . read only.  If you add a line later in the function and try to change . you will get an error.  The new style . declaration creates a variable that also has function scope.  We’ll look at block level scope of variables when we get to loops and conditionals shortly..If you remove line 1 in the example below, you will see that the code works just fine. However, as I just mentioned . will now be a global variable.  This can have all kinds of unintended consequences.  I once spent a week trying to track down an error in the code used to run the examples in this book, caused by me being too lazy to type . and creating a global!  To help catch these kinds of unintended variable creations JavaScript introduced ‘strict mode’ several years ago.  With strict mode enabled you will get an error for any variable that is not declared one way or another.  Run the example below to see for yourself.  To correct the error, add . in front of . on line 3.  From now on we’ll use strict mode, and only . and . to declare our variables..For simple user input in our practice functions we can use JavaScript’s . function.  This acts like Python’s . function except that it pops up a dialog box.  Again we could use some much fancier user interface to get the input, but we’ll leave the web page design for later..In the Python example we had to use . to convert the result of our input from a string to an integer.  This brings up two very interesting points..JavaScript usually does the right thing and automatically converts strings to numbers and numbers to strings when necessary.  Hence no need to explicitly convert the result of prompt to a number when we use it in the calculation..Whereas Python differentiates between . and . JavaScript has only a single numeric data type.  JavaScript does not support the infinite precision integers like Python does.  If you need that, you can find a module that implements it for you.  In JavaScript . results in 1.2676506002282294e+30 whereas in Python . results in 1267650600228229401496703205376..JavaScript has a boolean type.  But like Python many things evaluate Truthy and some things evaluate Falsey.  Like converting string to integer and vice versa JavaScript does its best to evaluate something as Truthy or Falsey based on the context its used in.  For example in Python an empty list, an empty string or dictionary, and . are all Falsey.  In JavaScript the following things are Falsey:  ., ., ., . . and . (note the lower case f).  Everything else in JavaScript evaluates Truthy especially . (note the lower case t)..The value . is used when you want to represent the absence of an object or value..A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.  If a function does not explicitly return a value then the value it returns is also ...Strings in JavaScript and Python are quite similar. Like Python, JavaScript strings are immutable. However, manipulating strings in JavaScript is not quite as obvious since Strings do not support an indexing or slicing operator. That is not to say that you can’t index into a JavaScript string, you can. You\ncan also pull out a substring just as you can with slicing. The\ndifference is that JavaScript uses method calls where Python uses operators..In fact this is the first example of another big difference between JavaScript\nand Python. JavaScript does not support any operator overloading. Table 3 maps\ncommon Python string operations to their JavaScript counterparts. For the\nexamples shown in the table we will use a string variable called “str”.  JavaScript uses zero-based numbering, just like Python..Python.JavaScript.Description.Return character in 3rd position.Return substring from 2nd to (and including) 4th.Return the length of the string.Find the first occurrence of x.Split the string on whitespace into a list/array of strings.Split the string at . into a list/array of strings.Concatenate two strings together.Remove any whitespace at the beginning or end.Replace all occurances of a with b in string str.Let us look at a simple example that will illustrate a few of the string functions.  We will write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns a new string with all of the vowels removed..This is a pretty simple example of the accumulator pattern using strings.  We iterate over every character in the given string, if the character is not a vowel we concatenate it to create a new return string.  If the character is a vowel we ignore it and move on to the next..The JavaScript version illustrates a few of the string methods and idioms and a few key differences.  First, to test whether one string contains another you have to use the . string method. This method returns a number to indicate the position of the string passed as a parameter in the original string.  If the given string is not present indexOf . -1.  The JavaScript string index operator does not support negative index values so there is no confusion that -1 clearly means “not found.”.The second difference is the . loop.  We’ll look in detail at the for loop later as there are many variations and subtle different kinds of . loops possible in JavaScript.  . is the best equivalent of the . used in Python.  With every iteration of the loop, . takes on the value of the next char in the sequence. The use of . restricts the scope of . to the loop, so once the loop is exited . does not exist anymore..The latest version of JavaScript adds two very welcome additions!  Multiline and formatted strings.  Prior to ECMAScript 6 JavaScript programmers did not have the equivalent of Python’s triple quoted strings.  This can be a real pain for web programmers who are constructing and inserting templated chunks of text into a web page.  JavaScript now supports multiline strings using the ` (backquote) character..Note that . prints a multiline string with the explicit newline characters. If you change the . to . you will see that the newlines are right where they should be..Python has many ways of doing formatted strings..The standard modulus operator for insertion  .The the format function: .As of Python 3.6 formatted string literals.  . These are a lot like format but the string just starts with f and you embed the name of the variable you want to insert between the curly braces..The JavaScript formatted strings are called Template literals.  They are closest to the new Python 3.6 formatted strings.  Like multiline strings they are delimited by backquotes..JavaScript template literals can contain expressions and can contain dotted and indexed objects as well.  In fact there is even more power in the template literals than we have seen here, but we will delay further exploration until the web programming section..Q-9: What is “hoisting” in JavaScript?.Q-10: Which of the following are valid JavaScript data types?.Q-11: Which of the above for loops will . print out the numbers 1 through 5 given the declarations below..Write a function to compute the sum of the first N numbers, starting at 0.",
        " ., the leader in open source security and license compliance management, announced today the extension of WhiteSource Prioritize, helping developers and security teams address open source vulnerabilities more effectively and efficiently..First introduced for Java, WhiteSource Prioritize will now support Python, JavaScript, and C#, greatly increasing the number of developers that can more easily manage open source vulnerabilities. With the sharp rise of reported open source vulnerabilities in recent years, software development and security teams are faced with new challenges as teams can no longer address all security vulnerabilities and remain on schedule. Prioritization is quickly becoming a necessity in order to focus limited development resources on the most critical issues.  .Indeed, by scanning open source components with known vulnerabilities and assessing their security impact, WhiteSource Prioritize can detect whether a developer's proprietary code is making calls to the vulnerable portion of the open source component – or whether the developer's code ever actually accesses the vulnerability. This then determines whether the detected vulnerability in the open source component actually represents a risk – and whether the vulnerability in question needs to be addressed right away. WhiteSource's research shows that as low as 15% of Java open source vulnerabilities actually present a risk and need to be urgently remediated..With only a small fraction of all vulnerabilities truly presenting a risk, “WhiteSource Prioritize is a real game changer for security and engineering teams,” said David Habusha, WhiteSource's VP of Products, “customers who have already upgraded to WhiteSource Prioritize report that their developers no longer need to spend as much time dealing with all of the security alerts in their systems; instead, they now move confidently and swiftly through a validated remediation process and save precious development hours.”.WhiteSource Prioritize for Java, JavaScript, and Python is available today, with C# support coming soon..\n.\n",

        "For the last few months, I've been spending a lot of time building things with the .. I had dabbled with it before, but having GraphQL become part of our free . motivated me to create some cool new projects..As I got to know our GraphQL API, I realized that I'd had a few misconceptions about how GraphQL worked. I'd incorrectly assumed that I needed to install a client library to be able to get data. Because the state of GraphQL client libraries is a little rough once you leave the Javascript ecosystem, I thought that using GraphQL wouldn't be that practical in other languages. With time — and teammates that gently pointed out my mistakes — I realized that all I needed to make a GraphQL query was an HTTP request..To demonstrate how easy it is to use GraphQL while also taking the time to correct my assumptions, let's take a look at how to query some data in a few different languages..Before we can get started, we need a query and an API endpoint to hit. Getting both of those items via Contentful is a breeze. For the API endpoint, we can use Contentful's API Base URL ., taken from the .. To find a query we can use ., an in-browser GraphQL IDE. Open up ., replacing the . and . with your own. .For this example, I'm using the space from my Serverless SuperHero website. Check out this . if you'd like to learn more, but the important part is it's already got some content models and content in the space. .From GraphiQL we can start creating a query. GraphQL is self-documenting, meaning that we can use both the documentation explorer and GraphiQL's built-in autocompletion (brought up via ctrl-space) to create a query. Hit the play button. If the query doesn't have any errors a JSON blob containing the data from your space will show up on the right. .I'll be using the following query, space id and access token in this example, but feel free to substitute your own if you'd like to try it yourself. .To start, let's make a request via .. Since cURL is a command-line utility, we can dive into all of our arguments before moving onto programming languages. We have a query, so we can modify the cURL example provided in the ...Even though the Contentful GQL API supports both POST and GET, we'll be using POST exclusively in this blog post, because POST enables us to send the query as a part of the JSON payload. If you’re using your own query, space id and accessToken, go ahead and replace them.  .When that command is run in a terminal it will output a JSON blob matching that of our previous example! Every one of our examples following this will use a similar format to the cURL request we made. .\nThere are few different ways to make an HTTP request in Python, which gives us options in how we'd make a GraphQL query. I'm a fan of the .. It's extremely simple although, unlike urllib, we will have to install it. .Since this is a new Python project, spin up a new virtual environment, install requests and create a new Python file. .In your newly created Python file, import the libraries. Set the space id and access token. I'd normally have this in a .env file. But, since this is an example, we can save it in the file..Create your endpoint URL and Authorization headers. I'm a fan of f-strings — the new way to do string manipulation in Python — so I'm using that format. Set the query and fire off the request. At the end, if we get a 200 HTTP status code, use the JSON library to format the output. .Run the code with . and you'll see a JSON blob!.\nSimilarly to the Python instructions, we'll be making use of an HTTP library for JavaScript. Since the JavaScript version of requests is no longer supported, we'll take advantage of .. In a new directory, run .. Create a new . file with the following code.  .We can run this example with . to get our JSON blob..Making HTTP requests with Ruby is something that we can do without installing libraries. Everything we'll use in the following example is already built into Ruby. Create a new . file with the following code. .We can run this file with .. .Similar to Ruby, we don’t need to install any libraries for PHP. Like the previous example, append your space ID onto the Contentful GraphQL endpoint, and set up the headers and request body. To wrap things up, make the POST Request. If you get a response without any errors, log the output. .Go ahead and run this with PHP request.php to get our final JSON blob. .We’ve made a GraphQL request over HTTP in five different ways (cURL, Python, Javascript, Ruby and PHP). If we really wanted to, we could simplify these requests even further by dropping the requests library from the Python or JavaScript examples, choosing to just use the built-in url processing capabilities of the languages. .These examples show how consuming GraphQL isn’t harder than a traditional restful API, but its benefits are far greater than Rest’s. By taking advantage of GraphQL, we’re able to get only the data that we requested in a single query. To make the calls that we used in our query example, we would have to make multiple requests to the Contentful Rest API. The response is more predictable, and we’re not bogged down with additional information that we might not need..Hopefully these examples can inspire you to dive deeper into this new way of querying data. If you're interested in learning more, check out our .. In it, Stefan from our DevRel team will walk you through how to get started with GraphQL, React and Contentful covering . (and much more). ",

GDP is best at measuring the impact of TV and car sales—not of things available for free or that require you to view ads, like broadcast TV or Facebook, explains the Financial Times’s ...As a new research paper points out, this shortcoming also means GDP may be missing a lot of value created in the form of free . (pdf).

Yet if a person chooses to contribute to those languages on their own time, as legions of devotees do, that is not directly counted—even though both create value. (This is similar to how ., typically done by women, does not make into GDP.).In their research paper, a set of economists and data scientists led by Carol Robbins of the National Science Foundation, attempt to quantify a share of the value being created by these programming languages. They do this by examining the code used to develop JavaScript, Python, R, and the . that is available on the code repository site Github..They find that based on the typical pay of computer programmers, the cost to develop the Github code for these languages would be over $3 billion—much of which was unpaid for. This is a very low-end estimate: A great deal of the code is not on Github and these are only four of the many open-source languages. The actual value could be magnitudes greater..With numbers like these missing from GDP, it’s hard to know exactly how much economic growth is happening.

        "In ., I covered how to reorganize XML sitemaps to isolate indexing problems..Let’s say you followed that process and now you have dozens of important URLs that are not indexed and you need to understand, in aggregate, the main causes of your indexing issues..In this column, we are going to learn something really exciting!.We will learn how to automate the Chrome browser, but more specifically, the . to check URLs in bulk and visualize any patterns affecting indexing..The URL Inspection Tool has grown so powerful that it has become an indispensable tool for effective technical SEO work. The tool has five primary use cases and we will automate most of them in this article:.If you had tried to automate this tool, you were probably frustrated to learn that there is no API available..So, how are we going to automate it with no API?.I’ll let you in on a powerful technique commonly used by software quality assurance teams: web browser automation..Most professional web development shops run automated quality assurance tests in the web browser. They do this to make sure the software works as expected as it is getting built..We will use browser automation tools and techniques but with the purpose of running our favorite new tool, the URL Inspection Tool, that doesn’t yet have an API..Please note that Google has explicit terms ., but their wording appears to be focused on Google searches as used by ranking trackers..It is possible they won’t be happy with this technique so ...In any case, it is not practical to check thousands or millions of URLs with this approach as you will learn below..We will connect our browser automation code to a running instance of the Chrome browser..We will manually log in to Google Search Console in this instance. Once connected, we will direct the browser to open pages, click on page elements, extract content, etc..The URL Inspection Tool is just one example I’m using to illustrate this powerful technique. You can literally automate any tool or task you regularly perform in a web browser..Let’s have some fun!.I decided to write the content extraction code in JavaScript because it is a more appropriate language when it comes to DOM parsing and DOM navigation..But, I’m writing the rest in Python as I still need to analyze and manipulate the data we’ll collect and Python is much better for that..The magic in this article is possible thanks to the excellent library . from Google’s Chrome team..We are specifically using the unofficial Python wrapper .. Puppeteer/Pyppeteer allows you to fully control the Chrome browser through the . interface..In order to get started download and install miniconda for your OS from this URL: ...It is not practical to run this in . because you need a local Chrome browser running..You can optionally install Jupyter to use it as you coding environment:.Install Pyppeteer.After I installed Pyppeteer (version 0.0.25), I faced . . that forced me to revert back to older versions of a couple of required libraries..After you have Pyppeteer and Jupyter correctly set up, you can proceed to start Chrome in debug mode to allow script control..First, create a separate user profile to hold the Google Search Console account user data and password..Let’s use this command in Mac..This would be the equivalent in Windows (I haven’t tested it)..We are passing two new extra parameters:.The first one enables remote control, while the second one creates another user profile so that our testing doesn’t mess with our regular browsing (if we use Chrome as the main browser)..When Chrome starts it will print out some debug messages to the console. You need to capture the first line that will look like this:.We are specifically interested in the URI that starts with .. Let’s copy it to a Python variable so we can connect to the Chrome instance..Next, let’s manually log into our relevant Google account and open Google Search Console..Now that we have a browser instance in debug mode and we are logged in to the Google Search Console, we will simulate user actions to automate the URL inspection tool..These are the specific browser actions we will automate:.In order to click on web page elements and extract their content, you need to specify their location in the parsed DOM. XPaths are one way to do this that ...You can also address elements using CSS selectors or JS paths directly, which are the approaches we will use in this article. You can use get the XPath/CSS selector/JS Path of any DOM element relatively easy in Chrome:.Right-click the element you want, click on “Inspect Element”, in the Chrome Developer Tools’s Element view, right-click again, under Copy, select JS path..We are going to run the URL inspector manually, and record all the selectors we need. We will use CSS selectors for elements we need to click and JS Paths for elements we need to extract..Here is the list I put together:.We will use this selector to click on the search box to bring it into focus, and to type the URL to search, including the ENTER keystroke..Note that this selector changes each time I load the Chrome browser, so I need to manually copy and paste it again to the script..We will use this element to learn if the page is indexed..The following selectors have two alternative paths depending on whether the page is indexed..We use this to extract the page that Google used to discover the inspected page..We use this to extract the date Google crawled the page..We use this to extract the canonical specified on the page..We use this to extract the canonical Google selected..The following selectors will allow us to click on buttons and tabs to perform the desired actions..Next, we will create a JavaScript function with all relevant JS paths used for extraction..We will pass this function to Chrome to execute on our target page and we will get back a Python dictionary that we can load into a . data frame..Most data extraction selectors have more than one option. We use a trick to execute the alternative if the first option fails. The || operator does just that, similar to how it works in Unix/Linux command line..Trying to get these data using Python directly is possible, but in this case it is a lot simpler and straightforward to use JavaScript..Now that we have completed all preparatory steps, let’s get to the fun part. Automating the whole thing!.Here is the code to connect to the live Chrome instance running with Google Search Console open..I added some extra code to control the window size. Feel free to update to adapt to your computer..Create a list of URLs you want to check. This list can come for example from an XML sitemap that under indexed....First, automating the browser is slow and resource intensive and you need to be logged into your Google account. If they don’t like this, they can easily ban your whole account..It is also possible that Google starts adding captchas if people start abusing this technique..Here is the code to open the main website page in Search Console..Then, here we can click on the URL inspector input box to bring it to focus..As you saw in the animated GIF at the beginning of the article, the coolest part is watching the browser typing the URL to check, character by character. It feels like magic..I first tried setting the input field value directly but it didn’t work..Next, we add a delay of 5 seconds to wait for the tool to run and check the URL. Feel free to increase it..When the report opens, we can go straight and run the data extraction, but as we are watching the browser perform tasks, I thought it would be useful to expand one of the hidden tabs..Now, the most important step. Getting the reported data for the URL back to Python. We pass the generated JavaScript function for Chrome to evaluate and return our data dictionary..Here is some example output..I will leave the following steps as an exercise for your to complete using the selectors I already provided:.After we let Chrome and Pyppeteer do the heavy lifting for us, we should have indexing data for the URLs that we checked in a list of dictionaries. We can convert them into a pandas data frame..Here is what an example run looks like..With the data in pandas, we can slice and dice it to easily isolate the main reasons for pages missing from the index..We can also export our data frame to Excel or CSV to share with other team members..If you are still on the fence about whether you should ., I hope that automating your day to day work gets you really excited about the possibilities. Your imagination and creativity are really the only limit..Here are some example community members who are picking up Python and seeing great success:.Thanks to you .

        "In this tutorial, we will implement an online presentation system where the presenter can share the screen contents and their video and audio in real-time, while attendees who join the presentation can watch..For the back end portion of this application we will use ., a Python web application framework, while the front end will be built using vanilla JavaScript. The . service will be used for video and audio streaming..The final application is shown below:.To finish this tutorial, you will need to meet the following requirements:.First, we need to create a directory to save our project:.Then change into the directory, create a Python virtual environment with Python's . module:.Note that in the last command above, your Python interpreter may be called . instead of . if you are using Windows. The second \"venv\" in the command above is the name of the virtual environment, a folder called \"venv\" will appear in our project directory after you executed this command..Now we can activate the virtual environment we just created by using the activate script inside our virtual environment folder. If you are using Linux or macOS:.Or if you are using Windows:.From now on, you will see a . prompt in your terminal or command line window, to indicate that you have activated the environment successfully:.Next step is install the dependencies for our project, which are:.- .: A Python micro web framework..- .: A library for communicating with the Twilio API..- .: A library for importing environment variables from .  file..Use the command below to install these packages:.The last step is to generate a requirements file (normally named .) to record the dependencies in the current environment so that you can replicate the same environment on other machines:.The content of the requirements file will look like this:.To connect your application with Twilio, we have to create a file called ., where we can save the needed Twilio account credentials as environment variables:.These values used to identify your account when you connect and talk to the Twilio servers. You can obtain them from your .. You can find the Twilio Account SID field in your dashboard:.The remaining two variables require a bit of extra work. First we need to find the \"All products & Services\" button on the left sidebar of the ., then find the \"Programmable Video\" service in the \"Communications Cloud\" section (click the \"Pin\" button to pin it on your left sidebar for convenient access). From there access the \".\" page on the \".\" menu. Click the red \"+\" button to create a . for this project. Give it a friendly name (here I used .), and keep the \"KEY TYPE\" as \"Standard\"..After clicking the \"Create API Key\" button, you will see the API Key (\"SID\" field) and the API Secret (\"SECRET\" field):.Copy and paste these values to the last two variables in your . file..Since these environment variables contain sensitive data, if you are going to use Git to manage your project, be sure to add . to your . file to prevent it from ever being committed into your Git history..Now everything is ready, let's start coding!.In the Flask application, the HTML templates and static files will be saved in . and . folders respectively. We will create these two folders at the root of the project directory:.When we have multiple pages in a web application, we don’t need to write the same layout element (e.g. ., navigation bar, page footer, etc.) in every HTML template. With Jinja’s template inheritance, we can create a base template which contains the basic page elements and layout. Then we can define some Jinja blocks in the base template that will be filled or updated in the child templates. You can learn more about template inheritance at ...In the . folder, we will create a base template to display the basic page layout called .. Below is the content of the . file:.We introduced two static files in the code above. The . in the . section will be added later. This file will have the CSS rules to style our page..At the bottom of the . element, we loaded the .. We imported this file from the CDN server provided by Twilio:.We also created two blocks. The . block will house the main content of the page:.The . block will be used to add more JavaScript files in the child templates used for the presenter and attendee pages..Our application is going to have two main URLs, one for the presenter and one for attendees. Below you can see the web page that will be used for attendees. This will be in a template file called . that you need to store in the . folder of the project:.Firstly, we use . Jinja tag to declare that this template inherits from the . template added in the previous section..Secondly, we have a . block to put our page content. In this block, we create a connection button to let the user join the presentation. The . element will be used to display the connection status. The two . elements are where the video streams will be presented: one for the screen track, and one for the presenter video track..Thirdly, we also have a . block, in order to append the attendee specific JavaScript to the corresponding block in the base template. The . allows us to preserve the content this block has in the base template..The new JavaScript file that we are importing is called .. This is where the front end application for attendees will be added..We will use the following CSS styles, which go in the . file. These will help to format the two video elements so that the video window is pinned to the top right corner of the screen window:.To help us distinguish the screen and video parts before the presentation starts, we give them different background colors: the screen window will be displayed in ., and the video window will be displayed in ...In order to display the index page, we will need to render the HTML file with Flask. Copy the following code in a file named . in the top-level directory of the project:.In the code above, we created a Flask application instance called ., then registered a function as a route with the . decorator. The . view function is used for rendering the index page we just created..Run the Flask server with the . command, as follows:.Now visit . on your web browser, and you will see our main application page:.Flask can automatically restart and reload the application when code changes and display useful debug information for errors. To enable these features in your Flask application, we will need to set the environment variable . to .. We can do this in a file named ., which is used to store Flask-specific environment variables:.Now when you run . the application starts in debug mode:.Now we will create a template page for the presenter called .. The content for this page is shown below. Save the . file to the . directory..The content of . is very similar to the one we created for .. In the . block, we changed the text of the connection button to .. We also do not have the container element of screen share..In the . block, we referenced a new JavaScript file for the presenter called . where we will write the presenter client logic..To expose the presenter page, we need to create a route for it in .. Add the following code at the bottom of .:.For your reference, here is a diagram with the current project structure:.The JavaScript front end will need to connect to Twilio to access the streaming and sharing features of the Programmable Video service. To connect to the Twilio servers, the clients need to authenticate with an access token, which is generated in our server..Below you can see an updated . that adds the . view function to generate Twilio access tokens for clients..Near the top of the file we retrieve the credential values that we saved in the . file, which Flask will automatically import into the system environment when . is installed. For this we use the . function from the Python standard library:.In the new . route, we check if the request was sent with a query parameter . and in that case we assume that the request was sent by the presenter. The query variable can be obtained with . method. If the request came from the presenter, then we set the . to .. Otherwise, we just generate a random username for the attendee with .. The username is stored in the user session, so that it can be recalled later..The . variable is part of the . package, while . is imported directly from the Python standard library..To use Fask’s . object, we will need to set a secret key in the Flask application instance:.The Twilio package for Python provides the . class, which is used to create access tokens. We pass ., ., ., and the . as arguments:.We then use the . class to provision the token with access to the video service. The . argument limits the token to a specific room:.The room name is defined in the global variable .:.To complete the function, we generate the token and return a JSON response that contains it:.To connect the presenter to the presentation, we will create a function to handle the connection logic. Add this code to a . file in the . directory:.In the snippet above, we create a . function that will be triggered when the presenter clicks the “Start Presenting!” button. Note how the function is bound to the . event of the button in the last line..To determine the current connection status, we will use a . variable that is initialized to .. The connect button acts as a toggle, so based on the state of the . variable it will initiate a connection to the video room, or disconnect from it..When starting a connection, we call the . function to finish the actual connection process and eventually set . to .. When disconnecting, we will call the . function to disconnect the user and end the presentation. The label and status of the connect button is always updated based on the connection status..Now let's jump into the . function. Add the code below to the . file:.In this function we return a ., which will let the caller bind success and error callbacks to it. The result of the promise is controlled by the . and . functions that are passed as arguments when creating the . object..We begin the connection process by obtaining an access token from the server. For this we use the . function to fire an AJAX request:.Notice we pass the query string . in the URL to tell the server that this is a request from the presenter. We also set the request method to POST by passing an options object..Next, we use . method to continue the call on the return value of the . call and turn the return value into JSON format with .. Since the . method will return a Promise object, we can bind additional . clauses to it. In the subsequent . call, we grab the token from the JSON response and connect the user to the video room by calling the . function from the . library, with the access token passed as an argument. We also pass an additional options object to set . to .. This is because by default, a participant in a video room subscribes to all media streams published by other participants. Since the presenter doesn’t need to subscribe to any other streams, we use this setting to overwrite the default subscribe-to-all rule. You can find more details about this in the . section in the Track Subscriptions Documentation..In another subsequent . call, we catch the return value of the . function, which is the room the user is connected to. Here we save the . object returned by . to variable . for future use:.Next, we publish the presenter’s screen share track. We will talk about the details of the . function later..In the remaining code, we define event handlers for when a participant connects or disconnects from the video room, update the state to connected, and finally resolve the promise..Below you can see the two event handlers for . and . event, which also go in the . file:.In these two functions, we just call the . function, which updates the number of participants shown in the page. Add this function also in .:.The video and audio tracks for the presenter will automatically be published to the video room upon connection, as this is the default. But we also want the presenter to see their own video. To display the video for the presenter, we will create a . function in ., which will be called when the presenter opens the page:.In this function, we call . to create the local video track. Once the video track is created, we append it to the video element of the page..In addition to the video and audio tracks, we need to create a video track for the presenter’s screen and publish it to the video room. Below we define a . function, which will be called when the presenter is connected. Add this function to . in the . directory:.Here we use . method exposed by web browsers to capture the screen stream via . (Web Real-Time Communication) technology, passing an options object to set the video height and width to fit the screen container element that we will use to display the feed to attendees. You can read more on screen sharing in MDN's ...The . method returns a Promise object. In the callback function, we create a video track object and save it to the variable .. We pass the screen sharing stream as an argument, and we also pass an options object that sets the name of the track to .. Giving the screen track a custom track name is useful so that we can distinguish it from other tracks when displaying the page for the participants..We then publish the screen track to the room with . method, passing the screen track as an argument..To complete the screen sharing set up, we bind the . event of this stream to the . function, so that the presentation ends if the presenter clicks the “Stop sharing” button:.The . defined above works as a toggle. When it is invoked to disconnect the video call it calls a . function to disconnect the presenter from the room and end the presentation. Here is the . function for the presenter, which also goes in .:.This function is quite simple, we just call . to disconnect the user from the room. This will also unpublish the video and audio tracks. Then we set . to . and call the . and the . function..In the . function, also in ., we stop the screen share and unpublish the screen track from the room.:.If the presenter refreshes the page or closes the page, the presentation may not reset correctly. To cover these rare cases, we will add a function to listen the .'s . event in ., that will be called when the user refresh/close the browser tab:.Make sure that your Flask server is running, make sure the URL in your browser is . in the refresh your page to force the browser to update all the files. You should now see your video stream. Then click the . button to begin a presentation. The browser will ask for your permission to enable the camera and the microphone:.Then you will be prompted to choose the screen/window/tab to share:.The final application when the presentation starts will look like this:.In the following sections we are going to implement the attendee front end logic, which has some differences to the presenter, but overall follows the same structure. The JavaScript file that will have the attendee logic is going to be called ., and will also be stored in the . directory..The . function for participants is almost the same as the one we created for the presenter:.However, the . function is a little different:.When calling the . method, we set . and . to . in the options argument, to prevent the audio and video from the participant from being published to the video room when connecting to the Twilio server. We also set . to . to disable the default . subscribe rule since we only want the participant to subscribe the presenter’s tracks instead of every participant:.Once the connection is made we call a . function to set the participant’s subscribe rule. Here is the definition of this function, which also goes in .:.In this function, we just send a POST request to the URL . on our server, where the subscribe rule will be set. We will define the server route soon..After setting the subscribe rule, we can receive the presenter’s tracks and display them on the attendee page. We iterate over the whole . map, which stores the information of all the participants and call the . function for each. We also set up handlers to receive callbacks when new participants join or leave the room in the future:.Here is the implementation of the . function. Add it at the bottom of  .:.The . attribute stores the participant's username. If the joining participant is the presenter, then we define handlers for the . and . events, which would allow us to receive the video, audio and screen streams..Here are the implementations of . and .. Add them to .:.The . event will be triggered when the presenter track is published to the video room. The event handler receives the track object as an argument. To display the track to the participant, we append it to the related element container. We use the . attribute to assign the video track and the screen track into the right containers..The . event will be triggered when the track is unpublished, which will happen when the presenter leaves the video room. In the . callback function, we detach the track from the HTML element and remove the corresponding media element..Finally, the attendee logic also uses the . function, which is identical to the one used in the presenter logic. Add a copy to .:.To complete the attendee connection logic we have to add the . route to our Flask server. Add the following view function at the bottom of . to handle the subscribe rule update:.To set the subscribe rule for a participant, we will need to create a Twilio Client object with . class and passing API Key and API Secret as arguments:.We obtain the username from the Flask user session. To update the subscribe rule for a specific user in a specific room, we use the . method, passing the . variable and the . we acquired from the . object..The . method accepts a list of rules in the . keyword argument. Each rule is a dictionary in the following format:.Since we only need the participant to subscribe to the presenter’s tracks, we use the . rule type and set the . filter to the presenter’s username, which is ...You can learn more about the subscribe rule at the . section in the Twilio Subscriptions documentation..To disconnect the participants from the presentation, we will create a . function in .:.In this function, we also need to call . to update the participant count message to show that we are disconnected..We also need to define a . event handler in .:.Here we add a notification for the participants when the presenter leaves the presentation..At this point the logic for the presenter and the attendees is complete. You can open two web browser tabs on your computer, connect to . in one, and to . in the other and test the two sides of this application..This is how the attendee’s user interface looks like:.Congratulations! We have finished the whole application. If you want to host a real online presentation and let your friends or coworkers join, you have to make your application public on the Internet. Instead of deploying your application to a web hosting service, we can use a tunnel forwarding tool to expose your local server to the Internet. While this isn’t as robust as a full deployment on a host, it is a good and simple solution to test the application. Here we will use ., we can install it via a third-party Python package called .. Make sure the terminal on which you run the following command has the Python virtual environment activated:.Make sure your application is still running, then in a different terminal window, activate the virtual environment and type the following commands to let ngrok expose . to the Internet:.Pyngrok will download and install the ngrok client when you execute the . command for the first time. Then It will output a command-line dashboard like this:.You can find a randomly generated public URL (.) in the . section. Share this URL to your friends, tell them to join your online presentation! The presenter will use the . URL to access the presenter page..In this tutorial, we only explored some basics of the Twilio Video service. You can learn more about it in the ..

        "\n.\n.By Carlo Milanesi.What does happen when a data collection is copied and then the new copy is changed? Does the original remains the same, or does it changes too?.If you think of copying as creating a completely new object, of course you expect that any change to the new copy does not affect the original object. But if you think of copying as creating a new name for the same, single object, then you expect that any change to the object through the new name appears also when you access the same object through the old name..Let's see how is the behavior of Python, Javascript, Java, C++, and Rust regarding the assignment operator (\"=\") between collection variables..Both using a Python interpreter and a JavaScript interpreter (like Node.js), if you write the following lines:.you get as output: [123, 20, 30]..This means that the a and b variables refers the same array object, so that when such object is changed using b, it comes out to be changed also accessing it through a..The same happens using Java. If you compile and run the following program:.The output is 123..C++ behaves differently, though..If you compile and run the following C++11 program:.the output is 10..The same output is obtained by the following C++ program:.This means that for both the std::array and the std::vector standard C++ collections, when a is copied to b, the whole underlying object is copied, so that such two variables represent distinct collections..We can say that Python, JavaScript and Java use ., while C++ use ...All this is explained in the section \"Assignment semantics\" of chapter 21 of my \"Beginning Rust\" book, reported in the rest of this post..What does the following program do?.Conceptually, first, the header of v1 is allocated in the stack. Then, as such vector has content, a buffer for such content is allocated in the heap, and the values are copied onto it. Then the header is initialized so that it references the newly allocated heap buffer..Then the header of v2 is allocated in the stack. Then, there is the initialization of v2 using v1. But, how is that implemented?.In general there are at least three ways to implement such operation:.This code generates the compilation error use of moved value: `v1` at the last line. When the value of v1 is assigned to v2, the variable v1 ceases to exist. Trying to use it, even only to get its length, is disallowed by the compiler..Let's see why Rust does not implements share semantics. First, if variables are mutable, such semantics would be somewhat confusing. With share semantics, after an item is changed through a variable, that item appears to be changed also when it is accessed through the other variable. And it wouldn't be intuitive, and possibly a source of bugs. Therefore, share semantics would be acceptable only for read-only data..But there is a bigger problem, regarding deallocation. If share semantics was used, both v1 and v2 would own the single data buffer, and so when they are deallocated, the same heap buffer would be deallocated twice. A buffer cannot be allocated twice, without causing memory corruption and consequently program malfunction. To solve this problem, the languages that use share semantics do not deallocate memory at the end of the scope of the variable using such memory, but resort to garbage collection..Instead, both copy semantics and move semantics are correct. Indeed, the Rust rule regarding deallocation is that any object must have exactly one owner. When copy semantics is used, the original vector buffer keeps its single owner, that is the vector header referenced by v1, and the newly created vector buffer gets its single owner, that is the vector header referenced by v2. On the other hand, when move semantics is used, the single vector buffer changes owner: before the assignment, its owner is the vector header referenced by v1, and after the assignment, its owner is the vector header referenced by v2. Before the assignment, the v2 header does not exist yet, and after the assignment the v2 header does not exist anymore..And why Rust does not implement copy semantics?.Actually, in some cases copy semantics is more appropriate, but in other cases it is move semantics to be more appropriate. Even C++, since 2011, allows both copy semantics and move semantics..This C++ program will print: 0 3 3. The vector v1 is first copied to the vector v2 and then moved to the vector v3. C++ move standard function empties the vector, but does not make it undefined. Therefore, at the end, v2 has a copy of the three items, v3 has just the original three items that were created for v1, and v1 is empty..And also Rust allows both copy semantics and move semantics..This will print 3 3..This Rust program is similar to the C++ program above, but here it is forbidden to access v1, at the last-but-one line, because it is moved. While in C++ the default semantics is a copy, and it is needed to invoke the \"move\" standard function to make a move, in Rust the default semantics is a move, and it is needed to invoke the \"clone\" standard function to make a copy..In addition, while the v1 moved vector in C++ is still accessible, but emptied, in Rust such a variable is not accessible at all anymore..###.JavaScript, Python, and Java have an efficient but somewhat surprising and error-prone semantics for their assignment operator. It actually copies the whole value for primitive objects, but it copies only a reference for composite objects, actually creating aliases to the referred object..Instead, C++ assignment operator has the safer and more consistent, but possibly inefficient, behavior of copying always the referred object. This is odd, as usually C++ is considered less safe but more efficient than the previously cited languages..Rust language manages to combine the semantic safety of C++ (i.e. no surprises) with the efficiency of Python, JavaScript, and Java (i.e. copy just the minimum required).. is a professional software developer and expert who uses Rust.  He has contributed to the Rust development community, and also  has done web application development in Linux with PHP, JavaScript, Java, Ionic and Vaadin frameworks.  Lastly, he has been in involved in these other technologies: GUI design, 2D and 3D rendering, testing automation, database access.  Carlo's applications include CAM/CAM for the stone machining industry, lens cutting laboratory automation, and corporate-wide web applications.",

Therefore, it is also used for:.Python allows disparate code to interoperate, giving rise to the semi-affectionate term, “glue language”. Python is regularly revised with new features to satisfy the evolving requirements of development teams.. calls JavaScript the “Programming Language for the Web.” This lightweight interpreted scripting language allows programmers to implement complex features on web pages, such as dynamically updated content, multimedia, animated images, etc. It can update both HTML and CSS and helps to extend the functionality of websites using third-party scripts..\nUnlike Python, which is used to develop the back ends of web applications, JavaScript can be used for both the . and . of web and .. Do, no cool pop-culture references, but a cool language for sure..Python supports modules and packages, making code reuse possible, which shortens development cycles. Programmers don’t have to start from scratch if the reused code will perform the same (or similar) function in the new application. They can, instead, write code to create unique, value-adding functionalities for the final product. Thus, code reusability helps to create better software, faster..Python’s built-in data structures, pre-built libraries and frameworks, and features like dynamic typing and dynamic binding also make it a very attractive proposition for rapid application development. Python is most commonly used for scripting and automation. However, it can also be used to build high-quality software, whether the requirement is for standalone applications or web services. Python also provides all the functionalities required to create REST APIs, comprehensive, data-driven sites, and more..Although Python is not the “fastest” language, it is still extremely versatile in terms of supported use cases. For instance, it is the preferred language for building Machine Learning applications related to speech recognition, financial services, or streaming entertainment services (think Netflix). Python also offers several built-in libraries for scientific computing and data science, for use cases related to astronomy, bioinformatics, statistical analyses, and even psychology..Python has a highly readable and straightforward syntax. It also follows indentation rules and doesn’t use enclosing braces. Being a dynamically typed language, developers don’t have to determine variable types. The interpreter will infer these types, and all checks will be made at runtime. Since programmers don’t have to worry about complexities, they can learn it easily, and start writing programs quickly.\n.The core client-side JavaScript language offers a very useful functionality that is massively popular in the world of web development today: the ability to build Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs make it easy to interconnect programs that would otherwise be difficult to do. Since the code is executed on the user’s processor instead of the webserver, it saves bandwidth and reduces the load on the latter. Moreover, fast processing ensures that results are available almost instantly, so pages load faster for the user..JavaScript is also useful for writing server-side code – using platforms like . – to provide and store resources needed by the client, and to respond to client requests (via HTTP) to deliver dynamic content to the user. In that sense, it keeps company with other programming languages like PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, Perl, and ASP.NET..Like Python, JavaScript is also an easy language to learn. Its syntax is close to English, and it uses an HTML DOM model that allows the language to quickly access, change, or react to all the elements of an HTML document. It can also change all the CSS styles on the page. This makes it a powerful language for creating dynamic HTML..Since JavaScript is an . language, not a . language; it does not require a compiler. The user’s browser reads the code, interprets it as HTML tags, and then runs it. JavaScript runs on many browsers out-of-the-box. It also runs on every device, unlike desktop or mobile applications that run only on specific devices or operating systems. This advantage makes it easy to write cross-platform apps..For such a powerful language, JavaScript is surprisingly easy to debug and test. All modern browsers come with a built-in JavaScript debugger that can be turned on or off as required. Many open-source, user-friendly testing tools are also available, including Cypress.io, Chrome DevTools, and Mocha.\n.Software is everywhere – websites, mobile apps, devices, machines, vehicles, factories, and everything in between.

        "Something a lot of beginners struggle with is the concept of passing data between different programming languages. It's far more simple to understand that a value exists in a variable which can be passed around from function to function. However, to go beyond the program's edges we must serialize our data in some way. We'll look at two ways that these two languages can communicate. AJAX requests via the new Fetch API, and piping between local processes..Serializing data means taking a value, object, or data structure, and translating it into a format that can be stored or transmitted. Most importantly, it needs to be put back together at the other end. Let's take look at JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON is a human-readable format and is straightforward for machines to read and write. The . is small enough to read during one cup of coffee. Both JavaScript and Python have standard library methods to parse and write JSON..JSON is built on two data structures. . — key/value pairs like a JavaScript ., and a Python . or .. . — a series of data like a JavaScript ., and a Python ...Let's do the same in Python by using the standard library module ... in JavaScript, you serialize to JSON with . and parse with ..

It's not only extremely fun to use, it's also great to prototype with. We'll use its . module which writes/parses JSON as well as setting the correct response headers (an application/json mime type). It requires two . to install and run a debug server. For myself on OS X, they were . and ...Code along or fork . to grab the code for all the examples..With our server running and serving us a page we can run JavaScript on, let's talk in JSON! We'll send a GET request with the Fetch API and receive a greeting from Flask. Before writing a single line of client-side code, I always use . to test my web servers — it's free and one of the industry standard tools for API testing and development..I'm running the following snippets in . tags inside .. There's nothing else inside . so the rendered page is blank. Everything happens in the console..Awesome! We've got Python talking to client-side JavaScript using JSON for data serialization. Let's flip it and send JSON to Python from the browser. We'll use the Fetch API again but it will be a POST request instead of GET.. Remember the difference between POST and GET. When you POST mail, you head to the post office with your letter filled with information. When you GET mail, you head to the post office again but this time you're picking up something that’s been left for you..With these two core building blocks, we've conquered JSON communication via HTTP.
