Academy also achieved record second quarter sales of $1.8 billion.\n\nWith these results, Academy has now posted eight consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales and operating profit growth since Q3 of 2019. Footwear and apparel were the strongest sectors, with footwear comps up 15% year over year and 27% compared to 2019 and apparel up 19% year over year and 37% compared to 2019.\n\nIn discussing the results in apparel and footwear, executives called out Academy's relationships with key national brands such as Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Columbia and the North Face, which have been top sellers in stores.
