A new programme by artist Theaster Gates aims to get it there. \n\nGates, who is also co-chair of Prada’s diversity and inclusion council, is leading a three-year programme for artists of colour, creating opportunities to amplify their work, invest in their development and expose them to organisations including Prada, who are interested in working with diverse talent. Based in Chicago’s South Side, the Dorchester Industries Experimental Design Lab will offer training, critical feedback and exposure for designers including amateur or self-taught artists of any age. In particular, the programme welcomes those without formal design education to help them create the same networks and opportunities as people who do.\n\nThis is about creating an “easier way to find the talent that is on the street and not in the schools,” says Gates in an interview.\n\n\n\n[#article: /articles/60d610b5f80a1d7005bcf6e6]\n\nEight to 15 people each year will receive the workshops and network opportunities across Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, as well as financial support of $10,000 to $50,000. The time spent with the cohort could lead to future opportunities with Prada, though it’s not guaranteed.\n\n“[Participants] will be ripe for an executive internship at Prada, or at least they will be in the Prada community so as opportunities come up, there will be a bigger constellation of people of colour that can respond,” says Gates. The project has the potential to open up to other cities and its employment prospects to other fashion houses. The first cohort will be announced in October 2021.\n\nPrada's latest efforts in diversity and inclusion are part of a broader movement in the fashion industry that has seen brands hiring chief diversity officers and establishing diversity and inclusion councils as a response to mounting pressures to bring in more diverse perspectives and voices into the industry.\n\nChinyere Ezie, the senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, says she welcomes the initiative. In 2019, Ezie filed an official complaint against Prada with the New York City Commission on Human Rights after spotting the brand’s Pradamalia figurines in the window of the brand’s Soho store.\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/612f8deec56fc2b99bf28e42]|||The Dorchester Industries Experimental Design Lab will provide new designers with education, critical feedback and exposure.|||\n\n“When I discovered [the] Prada blackface items, what was apparent to me was that there was a lack of people of colour who were being consulted in the company in order for such a detrimental incident to have occurred,” she says. “It felt like a critical intervention that more opportunities be made available for more people of colour to work in fashion. I'm very glad to see that Prada took up the suggestion that I made back then to make sustained investment in communities of colour to facilitate their participation in luxury fashion.”\n\nFinancial and employment outreach with minority communities was one of the requirements included in the agreement with the New York City Commission on Human Rights in 2020. The agreement also included sensitivity training, external monitoring of progress and the appointment of a diversity and inclusion officer, which Prada announced in October 2020 with the hire of Malika Savell. For Ezie, the settlement is a “shining precedent” for luxury companies and what they can do in the realm of diversity and inclusion. “The Prada settlement was the first of its kind and I hope it becomes an industry standard, something that all companies aspire to do,” she says.\n\nGates describes the Dorchester Industries Experimental Design Lab as “a cherry on top” of the basic agreement. “We are not trying to meet a quota,” he says. “I'm trying to build a very big constituency of designers of colour and join pre-existing constituencies of designers and artists of colour and say how can I be more useful? How can this platform be useful?”\n\nMore corporate efforts at Prada Group include finding diverse talent beyond the Italian schools that it has historically leveraged, says Gates. “Schools and universities, those are the low hanging fruit,” he says. “You need people who are on the ground. We have other networks and we bring so many other people that will never be in the education box.”\n\nGates says there is also internal work, including sensitivity training. Conversations are ongoing on the role of security guards in the brand’s retail stores and how to train them not to profile Black and Asian customers. “There is a tremendous amount of reflection that is happening right now in the company and with the hire of [chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer] Malika Savell there are people that are trying to ensure that as Black people come into the company they have a network of support,” he says, while acknowledging the challenging but essential conversations that may run alongside.\n\n“Not one person can solve the issue of race, racial bias and prejudice by themselves,” he says. “It requires that all the industries look very closely at themselves and ask themselves what else they can do to ensure that the diversity that is within our companies reflects the people who buy our products. Until we all take that on I think there is just a long way for us to go.”\n\n*Comments, questions or feedback?
