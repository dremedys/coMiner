        "The Federal Trade Commission said Monday that it is investigating the causes behind ongoing supply chain disruptions and how they are \"causing serious and ongoing hardships for consumers and harming competition in the U.S. economy.\".The FTC said it is ordering Walmart, Amazon, Kroger, other large wholesalers and suppliers including Procter & Gamble Co., Tyson Foods and Kraft Heinz Co. “to turn over information to help study causes of empty shelves and sky-high prices.”.Orders also are being sent to C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc. and McLane Co, Inc..“Supply chain disruptions are upending the provision and delivery of a wide array of goods, ranging from computer chips and medicines to meat and lumber,” FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in ...The companies will have 45 days from the date they received the order to respond, the FTC said..Along with understanding the reasons behind the supply chain disruptions, the FTC’s study will examine “whether supply chain disruptions are leading to specific bottlenecks, shortages, anticompetitive practices, or contributing to rising consumer prices.”.The FTC said the companies are required to “detail the primary factors disrupting their ability to obtain, transport and distribute their products; the impact these disruptions are having in terms of delayed and canceled orders, increased costs and prices; the products, suppliers and inputs most affected; and the steps the companies are taking to alleviate disruptions; and how they allocate products among their stores when they are in short supply.”.Companies also are required to provide the FTC with \"internal documents regarding the supply chain disruptions, including strategies related to supply chains; pricing; marketing and promotions; costs, profit margins and sales volumes; selection of suppliers and brands; and market shares.\". (NGA), which represents the independent supermarket industry and its wholesalers, said in a statement Tuesday that it was pleased to see the FTC move forward with the study..“This study is a key first step in promoting competition in the food supply chain,” Chris Jones, NGA senior vice president of government relations and counsel, said in the statement. “It will shine a light on what our members already know: that dominant grocery power buyers are using their size to demand better terms, better prices, and better products from suppliers, leaving their competitors and American consumers to pay the bill.”.Jones said the actions “leave independent grocers short-handed on key products their customers need and force small, independent grocers and their customers to bear a disproportionate burden of surging food price inflation during supply chain crunches.”.As the holiday season got underway, President Joe Biden tried to reassure shoppers that his administration was working to ease supply chain problems..Businesses are working to overcome lingering effects of COVID-related shutdowns and now issues arising from the strong recovery that has generated more demand than many ports, manufacturers and retailers can handle..The president spoke Monday with the CEOs of Best Buy, Food Lion, Samsung, Etsy and Walmart, among companies. The corporate leaders reassured Biden..“While we’re all concerned about the supply chain, we have more inventory than we did a year ago, and we have the inventory that we need to be able to support the business,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said. “And we are seeing progress. The port and transit delays are improving.”",
        "Advertisement.SEATTLE — Amazon has eclipsed . to become the world’s largest retail seller outside China, according to corporate and industry data, a milestone in the shift from brick-and-mortar to online shopping that has changed how people buy everything from Teddy Grahams to teddy bears..Propelled in part by surging demand during the pandemic, people spent more than $610 billion on Amazon over the 12 months ending in June, according to Wall Street estimates compiled by the financial research firm FactSet. . on Tuesday posted sales of $566 billion for the 12 months ending in July..Alibaba, the giant online Chinese retailer, is the world’s top seller. Neither Amazon nor Walmart is a dominant player in China..In racing past Walmart, Amazon has dethroned one of the most successful — and feared — companies of recent decades. Walmart perfected a thriving big-box model of retailing that squeezed every possible penny out of its costs, which drove down prices and vanquished competitors..But even with all of that efficiency and power, the quest to dominate today’s retail environment is being won on the internet. And no company has taken better advantage of that than Amazon. Indeed, the company’s delivery (many items land on doorsteps in a day or two) and wide selection first drew customers to online shopping, and it has kept them buying more there ever since. It has also made Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder, one of the richest people in the world..“It is a historic moment,” said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of the Marketplace Pulse, a research company. “Walmart has been around for so long, and now Amazon comes around with a different model and replaces them as a No. 1.”.Wall Street firms had been expecting this retail baton to change hands in the coming years. But the pandemic accelerated the timeline, as people stuck at home relied on deliveries. Walmart’s sales rose sharply during the pandemic, but it has not matched Amazon, which has added hundreds of new warehouses and hired about 500,000 workers since the start of last year..Walmart’s sales grew $24 billion in the last year, the company said Tuesday. During roughly the same period, the total value of everything people bought on Amazon rose by nearly $200 billion, analysts estimate..While the figures are calculated differently, analysts regularly use them as a rough comparison. Knowing the full value of Walmart’s sales is simple, because they nearly all come from its own inventory and are disclosed publicly each quarter. But analysts must calculate an estimate of the value of Amazon’s overall sales because most of what people buy on its site are products owned and listed by outside merchants. The company publicly reports only the fees it takes from those transactions..With Amazon’s success has come greater scrutiny. And the company has started to receive many of the same complaints — over its treatment of workers and impact on local and national economies — that Walmart faced during its biggest periods of expansion more than a decade ago..“The Big Bad Wolf is Amazon now,” said Barbara Kahn, a professor of marketing at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business who has written several books on retailing..Amazon and Walmart declined to comment..Over the last century, very few companies could stake a claim to world’s biggest retailer. The grocery chain A.&P. was such a force that antitrust authorities pursued it in the 1940s. . by targeting middle-class shoppers in the suburbs and expanding the department store model..Then came Walmart..In 1962, Sam Walton founded the retailer in small-town Arkansas. Mr. Walton had “a true passion — some would say obsession — to win,” he wrote in his autobiography, and he sold a huge variety of products at low prices, including eventually fresh food. But his true innovation was building a vast logistics network that operated with such precision and efficiency that it crushed many competitors that couldn’t compete..By the 1990s, Walmart had surpassed Sears. And then it kept growing, opening thousands of stores and acquiring other retailers across the world..Just as Mr. Walton founded Walmart as Sears was ascendant, Mr. Bezos started Amazon in the early 1990s as Walmart was king..Guru Hariharan, who worked on Amazon’s retail business, said Amazon had eclipsed Walmart by playing a different game. Walmart has hardened its lock on physical stores and the grocery business. But shopping online is growing far faster than in physical stores, even as it accounts for only about a seventh of U.S. retail sales. Amazon captures 41 cents of every dollar spent online in the United States, while Walmart takes just 7 cents, according to eMarketer..“They have their own turfs that they are the kings of,” said Mr. Hariharan, who left Amazon and eventually founded CommerceIQ, which advises brands like Colgate and Kimberly-Clark on e-commerce..Amazon has ascended in part because it opened its website to let third-party sellers list their products alongside items that Amazon buys and resells itself. This marketplace greatly increased the assortment of available items. Almost two million sellers offer products on Amazon, and they account for 56 percent of the items sold..The marketplace makes it harder to determine Amazon’s true influence in the retail industry. The company captures and reports only the fees it charges sellers to list, ship and market their goods, not the total money that flows through its business. The model is more profitable, but produces less revenue..“It makes Amazon appear smaller,” Mr. Kaziukenas said. “They are obfuscating their reality.”.That has led analysts at investment banks like J.P. Morgan, BMO Capital Markets and Cowen to estimate what is known as the “gross merchandise value,” calculating how much customers buy on Amazon, regardless of whether it comes from Amazon’s inventory or from a seller’s. The analysts make the estimates based on data the company releases, such as revenue it collects from sellers and the marketplace’s share of total units sold, and their own research. FactSet compiles and averages the estimates. .In the last 12 months, Amazon reported total retail revenue of $390 billion. But total product sales, including third-party transactions, was nearly 60 percent higher, according to the analysts’ estimates..Amazon has not regularly disclosed its gross merchandise value, but in 2019, facing antitrust pressure, Mr. Bezos shared the measure — then . — for the first time as a way to show that the third-party sellers were growing faster than Amazon’s direct retail business. “Third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt,” he wrote..When Mr. Bezos testified in Congress last summer, he pointed to Walmart’s size as evidence of a competitive retail industry. “We compete against large, established players, like Target, Costco, Kroger and, of course, Walmart,” he said, “a company more than twice Amazon’s size” — presumably referring to Walmart’s revenue..Walmart is still the largest private employer in the United States, with 1.6 million workers. And it sells more in the United States than Amazon, though J.P. Morgan estimates that Amazon will surpass Walmart in the United States next year..During the pandemic, Walmart honed its ability to use its stores as mini-distribution centers, where shoppers drive to retrieve their purchase “curbside,” a far less costly way to fulfill online orders than delivery. On Tuesday, Walmart said it expected to generate $75 billion in total online sales this year. The company has been expanding its effort to build its own marketplace, but the vast majority of its online sales still come from its own inventory, Mr. Kaziukenas said..Edward Yruma, a retail analyst and managing director at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said Amazon had only started to come to grips with the reality of its size..“Walmart is big, and they know it,” he said. Amazon has long played the role of the upstart, even as it became enormous. Just this summer, when it already employed about 1.3 million people, it . a new leadership principle that acknowledged the responsibility of its scale..“We started in a garage,” the new principle starts, “but we’re not there anymore.”.Advertisement",

        "*.Walmart and Amazon are two of the world’s biggest retailers—but who comes out on top? .In 2019, I wrote about seven areas where . compete. But times have changed, and so has the retail industry. How do these two retail giants stack up against each other in a post-Covid world? .Amazon and Walmart often compete for the same customers. As two of the biggest retail giants in the world, they also set the tone for other big box stores and online retailers. If Amazon or Walmart do something, you can bet that other companies will follow. .Since I wrote the original article in 2019, both Amazon and Walmart have expanded into new areas and weathered a pandemic. Here’s how they stack up against each other now: .As of 2020, Walmart’s total equity is $74.66 billion. For fiscal year 2020, Walmart’s revenue increased 6.7% to reach $559 billion. In Walmart’s first quarter of 2021, which ended May 1, the company had . of $138.31 billion, a 6.2% increase over the previous quarter. .Amazon’s total equity as of 2020 is $93.4 billion, and the numbers keep growing rapidly. In the first quarter of 2021, Amazon had net sales of ., a 43.8% increase over the same period in 2020.

In 2020 alone, Amazon added 500,000 employees around the world. .Amazon’s stock price is currently around $3,235, while Walmart’s is $141. .Winner: . by a nose, but Amazon is inches behind. Walmart still has bigger total revenue numbers, but Amazon is growing faster and catching up quickly. .Amazon and Walmart tend to be on the cutting edge for innovation. In just the last year, Amazon has announced biometric payments, Amazon Fresh grocery stores, FAA-approved drone deliveries and even a hair salon—all during a pandemic. The company continues to expand to new areas, including adding pharmaceutical offerings and strengthening its smart home devices. Amazon is even in talks to . for $9 billion.  .Amazon is a leader in innovative technology and automation. In 2021, Amazon will open a 350,000 square foot . in Massachusetts. The building is part of a $40 million investment into expanding robotic use in the supply chain and fulfillment.  .Walmart continues to innovate, especially in streamlining order fulfillment and the customer experience. In 2020, Walmart unveiled ., a platform that can pick, pack and deliver online grocery orders faster and more accurately than humans. .Walmart is also in the process of . by the end of 2021 to create a more streamlined and faster shopping experience for customers. The new design relies heavily on increased signage and an updated app to point customers to the exact location of each item, blurring the line between online and in-store shopping. .Winner: .. The company has changed the retail scene with its innovative products and services, and it continues to do so with its leading use of robotics and AI. .Financial growth is important, but it means nothing without a focus on customers, especially in the competitive e-commerce industry. Amazon ranks in the top five retailers in the ., although its score dropped 4 points from 2019 to 2020. Walmart has an ACSI score of 73, below the internet retail average of 78. .Amazon is known for its culture of customer-obsession. Its product recommendations and personalization are unparalleled, with . coming from recommendations. Amazon has also expanded its grocery delivery and product delivery options to better serve customers, including delivering straight inside customers’ garages. .Walmart understands the value of customer experience and has made many of its recent changes with customers in mind. Walmart’s . is designed to get customers to the exact items they need as quickly as possible. Its renewed emphasis on mobile and online shopping is also done to meet customer needs. .Related to customer focus is the employee experience. Walmart plans to . for U.S. hourly workers to $15.25 an hour to provide a liveable wage and retain employees. Amazon already pays its employees . and recently . for more than 500,000 U.S. employees.  .Winner: .. Walmart has made strides in this area, but Amazon is still untouchable with its seamless, convenient and innovative customer experience. .The Covid pandemic has put all stores on a fast track to digital growth, especially Walmart and Amazon. For the fiscal year 2021, Walmart reported .. Amazon is responsible for . in the U.S.—and growing. .Walmart’s updated app and store layout blurs the line between in-person and online shopping and makes a customer’s smartphone a valuable part of the shopping trip. In 2020, Walmart unveiled., its answer to Amazon Prime. The new service includes unlimited free grocery delivery, Scan and Go in-store shopping and gas discounts, among other perks. In its first five months, Walmart+ secured around.. .Aside from its digital shopping capabilities, Amazon has found success in Prime streaming video, which was used by more than. in 2020, with streaming hours up more than 70% year over year. Amazon Web Services continues to be the darling of the company, bringing in. in profits in 2020. .Winner: .. Its B2B and B2C digital solutions and especially its streaming growth set the tone for many other brands and will only continue to grow. .Walmart has long held the top spot in terms of physical retail presence. The company has more than . in the U.S—a number that has held steady for the past few years—and . live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. .Amazon is making strides with its physical retail presence. In 2020, Amazon expanded with its own grocery stores. Aside from its 500-plus Whole Foods locations, Amazon is also opening full-size . across the country. There are currently 11 stores in operation, with 28 more in the works, although Amazon is staying quiet about its plans. .Winner: ., but Amazon is catching up. Walmart dominates in physical space with its ubiquitous stores. Although Amazon is growing quickly, it still has a long way to go. .One of the hallmarks of the Amazon experience is quick shipping. Amazon sets the standards for all other e-commerce retailers with its same-day and next-day shipping for Prime members. .Amazon has also built out its fleet of trucks and planes to be completely in control of logistics. The fleet is growing rapidly, with an expected ., up from 50 in early 2019. Amazon is also opening a . in Kentucky in 2021, with room for 100 cargo planes and up to 300 trucks at any one time. In 2020, Amazon got FAA approval for its long-awaited . that has the power to deliver items in 30 minutes or less. .Walmart is following in Amazon’s footsteps with one-day shipping. In May 2020, Walmart unveiled Express, its two-hour delivery service. Walmart has made huge strides in automating its supply chain and order fulfillment processes for quick and accurate service. Walmart’s innovations make it possible for the company to track and seamlessly restock inventory. Walmart is also expanding its . to automatically fulfill customers’ grocery orders and converting more stores into automated fulfillment centers. .Winner: .. The company is building out its logistics arm to rival delivery companies and sets the standard for fast and innovative delivery options. In many ways, Amazon is now as much of a logistics company as it is an e-commerce company..In early 2020, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos introduced the $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund to invest in environmental initiatives. Amazon is also investing $2 billion in sustainable companies and technology to help the planet. The company has . to have half of all deliveries be carbon neutral by 2030, achieve net-zero carbon by 2040 and reach 100% usage of renewable energy by 2025. Amazon uses green office buildings with on-site solar. .However, Amazon is also one of the biggest producers of packaging waste, which comes with the territory of being the biggest e-commerce company in the world. One report estimates that Amazon generated . of plastic packaging waste in 2019, a number Amazon says is overblown. The company has made efforts to increase its recycling packaging, but much of it still ends up in landfills. .Walmart is also dedicated to lowering its carbon footprint. In 2019, Walmart bought more wind and installed more solar than any company in the U.S. and diverted 80% of its global waste from landfills and incineration. Its goals include . in U.S. and Canada operations by 2025, 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025 and 100% renewable energy by 2035. The company is also working towards sustainability throughout its supply chain with investments and improvements around the world. .Winner: .. Amazon made big strides with its sustainability investments in 2020, but it is still a major contributor to the problem. Walmart’s efforts aren’t as flashy, but the company is more transparent about its carbon footprint and is making progress around the world. .So, who comes out on top in the updated battle of Amazon versus Walmart? After phenomenal growth in 2020, Amazon wins the battle. The company is expanding rapidly while continually improving its service and fast delivery. .But keep an eye on Walmart. With a renewed customer focus and an established retail presence, Walmart could continue to see amazing growth..Both Amazon and Walmart set the bar for all other retailers on everything from logistics to customer service and innovation. If Amazon does it, Walmart and all other companies follow. Their continued push for customers helps move all other retailers to a stronger customer focus. ",

(NRF) predicted there’ll be about . taking advantage of doorbuster deals from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday this year compared to 2020. And shoppers are expected to shatter records with their holiday spending this year, too — the NRF reported sales during November and December will grow . over last year..As we’ve previously reported, the expected influx of shoppers paired with ., staffing shortages and . caused Black Friday sales to start exceedingly early this year across retailers. Jessica Young, director of research data at ., told us the biggest challenge for many retailers “is getting enough merchandise into their warehouses to accommodate all orders” due to raw material and shipping container shortages in addition to backed up ports..With retailers finding it difficult to restock their shelves and meet high demand this year, retail experts told us shoppers shouldn't hold out for better deals to come around — not even on Cyber Monday — as shopping last minute for the holidays . this year..“Even if shoppers think they're shopping ‘early enough’ to account for shipping, they might find that the item they want is out of stock until after the holidays — if there's a must-have on your list and it's on sale, buy it now,” said ., editor at RetailMeNot. Research shows many shoppers have taken that advice: A. found that 45 percent of shoppers said they started holiday shopping in early October..But it’s not just shoppers that are adapting to the early shopping boom. Research from Digital Commerce 360 found that retailers like Target, . and . were sending holiday-themed emails by mid-September, according to Young. Retailers and brands are also pivoting to more personalized ads and social media messaging to maintain consumer loyalty, especially as shoppers are “more willing than ever to switch brands or retailers” when items aren’t available, said Greg Kelly, a senior partner at . who leads their marketing and sales practice globally..Online shopping is expected to dominate this year’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping as overall demand and holiday spending surges, and it’ll “continue to increase as consumers are worried about items running out,” said Kelly..More people relying on e-commerce could bring holiday online spending to over $200 billion for the first time, according to Adobe Analytics’. report. And while you’ll find ongoing Black Friday sales and deals both in stores and online, several retailers were . on Thanksgiving for the second year in a row, including ., ., and . (. recently announced it’ll be . on Thanksgiving for good)..As we discussed in our ., the rise in demand for online retail sites has been . in recent years and exponentially increased as contactless e-commerce became the main way to shop during the Covid pandemic. In fact, Adobe reported that Black Friday was the . in U.S. history in 2020, right behind Cyber Monday 2020..With all the promoted sales and savings events this holiday season, what worthwhile deals should shoppers look out for? McGrath told us that key sale categories are usually the same from one year to the next. That means shoppers can expect to see major discounts on tech like tablets, smartwatches and wireless headphones..“AirPods and competing earbuds have been the stars of the Black Friday show the past two seasons,” said McGrath, adding that retailers like Walmart, Amazon and Target dropped wireless earbuds and headphones prices to record lows last year and will likely do so again. McGrath said these big name retailers will also host a variety of video games deals, including popular games for the . — although highly sought-after games aren’t expected to plummet that low..McGrath emphasized that Black Friday is one of the few times a year where discounts on Apple products are almost guaranteed — a great time to shop considering Apple isn’t known for hosting many deep discounts throughout the year. One of the best sales are on Apple Watches, according to McGrath: You won’t find many large price drops on the latest ., but you’ll find several discounts (around $50 or more) on older models like the . and ...However, shoppers should keep in mind that while tech is typically discounted across the board throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the Covid pandemic-induced . could result in popular tech gifts, including laptops, smartphones and gaming consoles (like the highly sought-after . and the .), to be even harder to purchase..Despite the large array of sales, some items can wait. Notably, holiday merchandise will be heavily discounted after the holidays and retailers usually offer better deals on large appliances and mattresses during Labor Day, Memorial Day and other holiday weekends, according to McGrath. She also previously told us that . — like the ones we usually see for TVs — may be “cheapened for mass consumption” or equip “lower-quality components, fewer HDMI ports and other problems.”.When it comes to finding the best ongoing Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals to shop, there are . to make sure you’re getting the best price. Price trackers and browser extensions like . and Honey can automatically apply coupon codes to your cart at checkout, while . lets you see the cheapest buying option across multiple retailers. Most of these tools — including . and the . browser extension — can monitor prices and alert you when those drop for certain products..Several retailers also provide price match guarantee policies, which allow you to notify a retailer of a lower price at another competitor and the retailer will then match that price. Big name retailers like . . and . began offering price matches while rolling out their Black Friday sales in October — but there are exceptions. For example, Target and Best Buy will only price match for certain competitors, and Best Buy won’t price match competitors’ special Black Friday pricing starting Nov. 19 through Cyber Monday (Nov. 29)..McGrath recommended shoppers utilize cash back rewards on their early purchases so they “can put money back in their pockets to use later in the season or in the new year — and help ease some costs down the line.” You can use a combination of . to ensure you're getting discounts, points and cash back on your Black Friday and Cyber Monday purchases. There are several . that’ll let you earn cash back and save on products from ., ., . and more.",

Amazon (.), Walmart (.), Target (.) and Office Depot (.) are some of the big-name online and retail companies representing importers. DuPont, Tyson Foods and Louis Dreyfus are among the major players that will represent exporters..“I and the other Commissioners need rapid access to the perspectives of importers and exporters on the ground dealing with the realities of ocean shipping every day,” said FMC Chairman Daniel Maffei. “We also need them to meet and help guide our efforts and those outside the FMC to improve the system and make it easier, fairer and more efficient to American shippers. I am truly grateful to all of those who volunteered to serve on what I know will be an invaluable committee.”.NSAC was established as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY21 on Jan. 1. The function of the committee, according to the law, “is to advise the [FMC] on policies relating to the competitiveness, reliability, integrity, and fairness of the international ocean freight delivery system.” FMC will have authority to consult NSAC “on significant agency actions relating to the committee’s functions,” the law states..However, NSAC’s duties are “solely advisory,” according to the law, and the FMC is not obligated to act on its recommendations..The goal of the FMC was to balance the membership of NSAC and “consider factors to include commodities shipped, ports used, geographic areas served, and origins of cargo, as well as other relevant factors.” Committee members will serve until December 31, 2024..The 12 importer members and their representatives:.Amazon (Adnan Qadri).Walmart (Michael Brock).Office Depot (Rick DiMaio).Target (Scott Fremont).IKEA (Debb Minskey).Wayfair LLC (John Esborn).Wine and Spirits Shippers Association (Alison Leavitt).MEMA/Auto Car Association (Steven Hughes).Brenntag North America Inc.

        "Amazon. Walmart. eBay. Target. Tmall. Mercado Libre. Rakuten. Zalando..Each one of these ecommerce marketplaces comes with its own benefits, drawbacks, and business models that affect how sellers do business on the platform. Learning the ins and outs of so many platforms, and learning how to best scale your brand on each of them, can be a daunting task for even the most experienced ecommerce teams. .Below, we’ll take a look at two of the most prolific ecommerce marketplaces in the U.S.—Amazon and Walmart—and tell you everything you need to know to either establish or maintain your brand’s presence on the platform..While the . opened in the 1960s, Walmart didn’t step up as a strong competitor online until 2016 when it . With the Jet acquisition, Walmart suddenly had the resources and framework it needed to focus and expand its ecommerce efforts..Walmart has seen consistent ecommerce growth since then, acquiring several more ecommerce businesses and building its ecommerce presence. In 2020, Walmart hit a milestone as it .. Walmart ecommerce ., and year-over-year from 2020 to 2021, the Walmart marketplace saw triple-digit growth..Despite Walmart’s rapid growth, the retail giant still trails behind Amazon. Jeff Bezos . in 1994 and initially began its rise to ecommerce prominence by selling books. By the turn of the century, Amazon expanded its inventory to sell a wider variety of products, more closely resembling what consumers know as Amazon today..Although Amazon didn’t . until 2001, Bezos spent years laying a solid foundation for the future of the company by convincing investors of the potential of Amazon’s model. Investors believed their investments in Amazon would pay off, and they were right. Amazon has revolutionized and dominated ecommerce sales and become the second-ever .. In the last decade especially, Amazon has become increasingly profitable and pursued its goals even more aggressively..Despite Walmart’s efforts to focus on ecommerce, it’s still a brick-and-mortar first company. Walmart follows an ., meaning product costs are consistently low without sales or discounts. The mega-corporation scales volume as much as possible to translate lower costs into lower prices for consumers. .This model means that vendors in a 1P relationship with Walmart need to show up to negotiations with the lowest possible price. Walmart will end relationships with vendors holding unnecessary profit. .Amazon relies on a model that Bezos has referred to as the . model. The goal is to build the best platform possible, and with that platform, attract the largest number of products, which will then attract more consumers, which in turn attract even more sellers and products. The flywheel naturally reinforces itself over time..As opposed to Walmart, Amazon has a more diversified business model, thanks to Amazon Web Services and Amazon’s digital advertising services. Amazon’s technology and software infrastructure businesses have high margins that make their ecommerce business possible and profitable. While Walmart is growing its ecommerce operations from a perspective of scale to achieve profitability, Amazon has additional businesses that fund and support their ecommerce that make it possible for Amazon to compete on price..Amazon and Walmart also slightly differ in the selling options they offer their vendors. Amazon essentially offers three options: .. In a 1P model, vendors sell their products wholesale directly to Amazon and Amazon handles the rest. In the 2P model, also known as Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA), sellers own their products and sell them directly to consumers, but Amazon houses the products in its warehouses and fulfills orders. In a 3P model, sellers simply use Amazon as a platform to reach more customers and directly handle their own product fulfillment, pricing, and listings. Choosing between options like . is a decision each brand should make based on its products and shipping capabilities..For the most part, Walmart’s selling models closely mirror Amazon’s, with Walmart Fulfillment Services directly competing with FBA. However, Walmart also offers an additional ., in which Walmart handles the product listings, content, and pricing, but sellers hold and ship their own inventory. Giving sellers the convenience of a 1P model and control of a 3P model is unique to...Although brick-and-mortar Walmart stores tend to attract low-income shoppers, that trend doesn’t translate to ecommerce. Walmart.com and Amazon have similar customer bases—in fact, . that 45% of Walmart+ subscribers also have an Amazon Prime account, and 19% of shoppers switched from Amazon Prime to Walmart+..Amazon customers may tend to be slightly higher-income than Walmart customers simply because not all shoppers can afford Amazon Prime, which costs about $119 a year. While Walmart Plus also charges a monthly fee that comes out to about $98 a year, Walmart offers free 2-day delivery on many items even without Walmart Plus, making it more accessible for shoppers who don’t want to pay a monthly or annual fee. .Ultimately, Amazon is the most important ecommerce marketplace in the U.S. If you want your brand to succeed in ecommerce—and even in retail stores—you need to sell on Amazon. Amazon has become central to consumers’ lives, and selling on Amazon is critical for brands to stay relevant and profitable. .In part, this is because many consumers now use Amazon as a research platform. Even when consumers are shopping in a brick-and-mortar store, they use their smartphones to compare product listings and reviews on Amazon to better understand the options on the physical shelf in front of them. Amazon also offers options like. and . to make selling as simple and cost-efficient as possible. .Even though selling on Amazon is a good idea for virtually every brand, there are still some platform drawbacks for sellers. Amazon has worked hard to automate everything it can, which sometimes leaves sellers without support. .Amazon also forces you to equalize pricing across your channels, which can be a challenge if you can’t control what’s happening on all channels. If you’re in a 1P relationship with Amazon, for example, and want to sell your product on Amazon for $50 when it’s sold for $45 elsewhere on the web, Amazon will then lower the product’s price to $45 without your permission and make you pay the difference. If you’re in a 3P relationship with Amazon, Amazon can’t change your pricing, but it may turn off the Buy Box if your product is priced lower on other websites, still affecting your sales and profits..With the rate of Walmart’s ecommerce growth, it’s becoming a necessity for brands to also establish a presence on Walmart.com. It’s almost universally a good idea to sell on Walmart’s marketplace. The one exception may be if you own a premium brand whose image may be tarnished by selling on Walmart, but .. If you already have a presence on Walmart, nurturing that presence will help you ride the wave of Walmart’s growth. .Another relevant benefit to selling on Walmart.com is protecting your brand from .. Having price parity and content parity across many marketplaces instills consumer trust in your brand. In an increasingly competitive ecommerce landscape, selling on Walmart.com also equips brands to better compete—if your item isn’t available on Walmart.com, you can bet that a competitor’s item . be available in its place. Considering the rate of Walmart’s ecommerce growth, these sales will quickly add up..Data also shows that if a product is unavailable on Amazon, many consumers then search for the same product on Walmart.com. If your product is available on both platforms, your brand can still land the sale on one platform even if it’s out of stock on the other..While the benefits of selling on Walmart certainly outweigh the costs, brands should be aware that it’s a bit more complicated to start selling on Walmart compared to Amazon. Walmart’s seller application process is a bit more rigorous, and Walmart is picky with which brands it takes on as sellers. Since Walmart’s Seller Center is a new platform, it’s more complicated to use than Amazon’s Seller Central, and Walmart is still in the process of working out inconvenient bugs and quirks. Another upfront cost to consider is that Walmart, unlike Amazon, requires each product to have a UPC. .Once your brand is established on Walmart’s website, though, it’s fairly straightforward to maintain. Walmart lives up to its motto “by sellers, for sellers” and makes seller support fast and easily accessible. Unlike Amazon, Walmart gives its sellers same-day responses and any issues with the platform can typically be resolved within 24 hours. Additionally, unlike ., Walmart does not charge sellers any setup or monthly fees. .In light of all this information about Walmart vs. Amazon, where should your brand focus its efforts? The answer is both. Amazon is the most important ecommerce platform in the U.S. Walmart may generate a smaller portion of your revenue, but you can expect a higher percentage growth rate over the next several years since the platform is growing so rapidly. .There may be some products and brands that are better suited for one platform than another, but you can’t go wrong with selling on both the largest and fastest-growing ecommerce platforms on the web. .Need help establishing and maintaining your brand’s presence on Amazon and Walmart?

        "Amazon and Walmart are without a doubt the largest online retailers out there—maybe you’ve heard of them! For anyone wanting to sell items online, these two ecommerce giants are the natural place to look first..Due to its low barrier to entry and online-first nature, many brands start their ecommerce journey on Amazon. But with Walmart’s ecommerce sales skyrocketing in 2020, and more people than ever using their Online Pickup & Delivery service, Amazon sellers are currently flocking to Walmart to put their items in front of this growing market. When these sellers make the jump to Walmart.com, we often see them taking the content they have on Amazon and adding that same content to their Walmart pages..Simply syndicating your content made for Amazon or another retailer may seem easiest, but it’s more than likely that this content is in violation of Walmart’s Style Guide requirements. You may be able to get your items live on Walmart.com with hand-me-down content, but without optimizing your item pages for Walmart’s unique platform, your pages won’t be nearly as discoverable..That’s because the content you add to your item pages on Walmart and Amazon isn’t just for shoppers to read—retailers use a page’s content to determine what search results it shows up in and how highly it ranks for those searches..The thing is, Amazon and Walmart’s search algorithms just work differently. Even content that’s optimized for Amazon’s search engine will most likely fall short on some metrics specific to Walmart’s..If you want your pages to rank highly in search results on both retailers, it’s essential to set up your pages differently to follow their unique rules correctly. Let’s take a look at a few specific ways that best practices for content on Amazon and Walmart differ:.Content has more of a one-size-fits-all approach at Amazon, with different recommendations only when necessary. Amazon also encourages sellers to add enhanced content through its internal tools (more on that later).. Content Quality Scores are Walmart’s measure of how optimized a page is for search on their platform. You can get your score from your Walmart merchant, or by using SKU Ninja’s . tool..Even with the best content out there, it’s still unlikely either of these retailers will show your page to shoppers if it’s out of stock. The retailers also use sales data to push items up in search results that shoppers are more likely to ultimately buy. That’s why it’s so important to include content that converts shoppers on your pages, your sales & search rank depends on it!. as a notable exception to the usual functions of both search engines. These items are placed at the top of search results outside of the search engine’s usual algorithms directly by or through the retailer, as advertisements or special promotions..The more keywords you can fit into your title, the more searches your item is eligible to show up in. The first 100 characters are checked by Amazon’s search engine, with a total character limit of 200..Walmart’s algorithms prioritize short, readable titles with standardized capitalization of brand names and abbreviation of units like weight or volume. For mobile shoppers (49% of all ecommerce sales and growing, according to Statista!), only the first 36-52 characters in your title will appear before being cut off by the screen’s size. That’s why it’s important to put the most important descriptors of your product at the beginning of the title so they remain visible.\n \n.It’s often the first thing seen in search results and an essential tool for getting a shopper to click on your item..Item page experts know that titles, descriptions, and images are the fundamentals of ecommerce content, but enhanced content is crucial for keeping your pages competitive and converting more shoppers..Also called rich media, enhanced brand content, or A+ content, enhanced content is anything on your item page that goes beyond traditional descriptions and photography. This includes video, interactive elements, comparison tables, and parts of an item page that combine photography and text (called A+ Content on Amazon, or Feature Sets on Walmart)..So, how do you move your enhanced content from Amazon to Walmart? Very few Walmart suppliers are able to upload videos through their merchant or first-party platform, but the majority of enhanced content on Walmart.com is hosted by Walmart’s Connected Content Partners (CCPs) like SKU Ninja + WhyteSpyder. .SKU Ninja’s . lets you upload videos and create feature sets (A+ content on Amazon) to submit to your Walmart item pages. You can submit enhanced content to Walmart items using SKU Ninja starting at just $5 a month!.SKU Ninja is ecommerce software built to make working with the world’s largest retailers easy, automated, and efficient.

One well-known example is the battle between Walmart and Amazon. .While some commentators now predict that . as the leading retailer by 2022, others champion Walmart’s latest gains in ecommerce. Sellers, too, are paying more attention to Walmart Marketplace as coronavirus impacts highlight the risks of over-relying on Amazon. But the differences between the two platforms are vast. .In this blog, we’ll cover those key differences. We’ll explore how Walmart’s efforts have added up over the years, and what sellers should expect from each platform. How easily does your approach to Amazon translate to Walmart? What does it take to succeed on either platform? Read on to learn more..<div id=\"market\"></div>.Amazon.still remains the undisputed number one in ecommerce, accounting for nearly 40% of ecommerce sales today. When the coronavirus pandemic disrupted its supply chain and severely delayed . in early 2020, Amazon still saw a 25% surge in online sales—.. .That being said, operating profit fell dramatically from $2.3 billion to $1.3 billion during the same time period in the North America segment. COVID-related costs totaled to more than $600 million. (The company itself raised eyebrows when it committed to spending $4 billion on higher wages, PPE and other COVID-related expenses in the second quarter.) And the vast majority of pandemic sales came from low-margin products, like food and cleaning supplies. .Amazon is likely to remain unfazed in the long run. As conventional retailers face heavy, if not permanent, blows to their brick-and-mortar businesses, Amazon stands to operate at an advantage for years to come. . echoes the sentiment of many with his claim that “This could be the biggest boon ever to Amazon.”.Walmart passed a critical inflection point in 2020. For the first time ever, it was reported that . as the second largest ecommerce retailer in the U.S. behind Amazon..Its . in the first quarter of 2020. The biggest driver was online grocery sales, which \"permanently catapulted three or four years into the future in just three or four months,” according to .. .When Amazon Prime orders faced month-long delays, overall Walmart Marketplace orders skyrocketed and . in early April. This speaks, in part, to Walmart’s dominance as a brick-and-mortar retailer. Self-proclaimed as the world’s largest retailer, the company has more than 5,000 stores in the U.S. that can double as fulfillment centers or pickup locations (compared to Amazon’s 200 North American warehouses). .“During the pandemic, Walmart used technology and stores to out-satisfy Amazon,” said ., lauding Walmart’s omnicommerce strategy. Walmart is well-positioned to dodge inventory issues that still choke Amazon today..In the midst of this success, Walmart also announced it was phasing out Jet.com. The retail giant acquired Jet in 2016 for more than $3 billion as a foray into ecommerce. ., Jet.com is being cast aside to make room for its own marketplace. This move reflects the company’s confidence in Walmart.com—good news for sellers looking to launch to its marketplace—as its ecommerce sales are finally starting to grow at a faster clip. Since its Jet.com acquisition, Walmart’s ecommerce sales have nearly tripled. .<div id=\"fees\"></div>.Amazon’s Professional selling plan costs $39.99 a month. There are generally no listing fees, though there is a “referral fee” for each sale. ., with several categories charging as much as 20%. Amazon also enforces a minimum referral fee per category. .Certain categories, like media, come with additional service fees or variable closing fees. The vast majority of Amazon sellers (73%) also pay ., which are either determined by unit or weight. Storage fees are charged separately, as are many other related services (FBA label service, returns processing and removal orders, to name a few). These fees can quickly rack up if you’re not keenly aware of how they work or how your inventory is performing..Walmart Marketplace doesn’t charge any setup or monthly seller fees. Sellers are only charged referral fees that generally range between ., similar to Amazon’s rates. .Walmart’s new . charges monthly storage fees and per-item fulfillment fees. WFS fees are simple compared to FBA. However, far less sellers are eligible for the program. Only existing Walmart Marketplace sellers can gain access, and new sellers are not likely to be approved right now..Aside from these fees, Walmart requires UPCs for every product you want to list (though exemptions are available in certain cases). UPCs can . for a batch of a hundred or more codes. GS1, the official provider, also charges annual renewal fees starting at $50. .<div id=\"listing\"></div>.Amazon offers a touchless launch process. Once you’ve purchased a selling plan and set up your Seller Central account, you can create your first listings through a number of options:.Create individual listings manually through Seller Central. using Amazon’s inventory file templates.Tap an integration partner, like Zentail, to automatically format and categorize your product listings.Most categories on Amazon require products to have a standard ID, such as a Universal Product Code (UPC), European Article Number (EAN) or an International Standard Book Number (ISBN), but if your product already exists on Amazon, you should be able to add your offer without a GTIN. In some categories you can also request GTIN exemptions to get your products up on the marketplace. .One of the most difficult aspects of listing management is keeping up with Amazon’s constantly changing criteria. For example, in 2019, Amazon overhauled its . with little notice. Sellers were forced to submit a slew of new attributes for every shoe listing—or risk having their ASINs removed..Even among seasoned sellers, listing errors are commonplace. It’s therefore advised that you enable a ., interpreting and resolving cryptic error messages. Too many errors will not only render your listing unsellable, but can also lead to stranded FBA inventory that will incur hefty fees. .Walmart Marketplace is notoriously harder to onboard. New sellers must .and undergo a “trust and safety” review. During this process, sellers need to demonstrate previous marketplace experience, a high level of professionalism and other qualifications. This review can take several weeks, although working with an official channel partner such as Zentail can cut down the process to just a few days. .Once accepted, you will receive a launch checklist with step-by-step instructions for registering your company. You can create a new listing via manual setup, Excel upload, API or through a software partner. Keep in mind that Walmart’s APIs are relatively underdeveloped; they can be hard to work with if you don’t know the right way to format your product data or can keep up with continual changes. Therefore, it's highly recommended that you tap a software partner or see if . makes sense for you. .Another core difference, as mentioned before: Walmart requires a UPC for every product you list, so if your product doesn’t have one yet, you’ll have to obtain one or submit a case specifically asking for an exemption. According to sellers who've been approved for UPC exemption, Walmart will send a list of questions to better understand your reason for exemption, the category for exemption, your company background, forecasted sales and links to products requiring exemption. .In general, this UPC requirement has been a source of headache for some sellers. Sellers report encountering issues with duplicate listings and/or not being able to choose which listing to sell on. UPCs may also be associated with the wrong product if, say, another seller purchased a false code from a provider outside of .. The only remedy to this situation right now is to locate the “right” UPS and submit a case with Walmart Seller Support. .<div id=\"price\"></div>.In line with its goal of being the “everything store,” Amazon operates a marketplace open to all sellers. Its U.S. marketplace has ., with more than 86,000 new sellers joining in 2020 alone. .A significant percentage are based abroad. In fact, Marketplace Pulse reports that among the top 10,000 sellers, .. As a result, price competition can be intense and fluctuate suddenly. To stay competitive, sellers need an automatic repricer that can keep up with constantly changing prices. The best options .—they can keep you winning the buy box at the highest possible price, so you neither lose a sale nor kill your margins. .That being said, having the lowest price isn’t the only key to winning the buy box. FBA or Seller-Fulfilled Prime (SFP) sellers historically beat out any other seller, even if their prices are slightly higher. This is because Amazon can guarantee on-time, non-defective deliveries more consistently than the average FBM seller.            .On the organic front, price comes second to your sales history, according to our partners at .. The higher your sales velocity, the more likely you are to rank on Amazon’s search pages. Text matches, product availability, reviews and selection are other important ranking factors. Some analysts note that the A9 algorithm  still looks for listings that deliver better margins for Amazon, whether via FBA or advertising participation. .Walmart is, unsurprisingly, strict when it comes to pricing. Uncompetitive pricing is the number-one reason for getting delisted on its marketplace. One recent . showed that overall, Walmart was cheaper than Amazon by 10.4%. Walmart showed lower prices for groceries, technology and home goods, but higher prices for kitchen and appliances. .While price erosion is largely driven by competition on Amazon, Walmart’s pricing culture is mainly defined by two pricing rules: .. If one of your products can be purchased from your store on a competing website at a lower price (including shipping), the product will be delisted on Walmart..‍.. If one of your products can be purchased from any seller on Walmart.com or any competing site at a drastically lower price (including shipping), the product will be delisted..‍.Competition overall is lower on Walmart. With just . who are all domestically based, Walmart Marketplace offers prime real estate for new seller—sellers get 13x more visitors a month compared to sellers on Amazon, reports Walmart, due to a less saturated space. Worth noting though: the number of Walmart marketplace sellers has doubled since July 2019, indicating its rapid growth..Buy box competition is also less intense. It’s important to note that Walmart restricts repricing to approximately once per day, so you can’t use a repricer in the same way you would on Amazon. Pricing updates need to be extremely deliberate, while at the same time reactive to various market variables. .<div id=\"shipping\"></div>.Amazon rewrote the rules—and effectively recalibrated consumer expectations—when it comes to shipping. Prime members now enjoy free shipping on both two-day and next-day deliveries. .Consequently, 73% of Amazon sellers use FBA to gain access to the Prime badge. It has become a necessity to compete on Amazon—yet, recent months have gone to show that it’s dangerous to rely on FBA alone. Thousands of sellers were shut down overnight when Amazon temporarily banned nonessentials from FBA in March 2020. .Today, many sellers opt for a hybrid approach, in which at least part of their inventory is kept with a 3PL or their own warehouse. ., for example, is a popular alternative among sellers. The tech-enabled 3PL offers two-day shipping and greater visibility over the location and status of your inventory. .Amazon’s SFP beta program, which lets FBM sellers participate in Prime after meeting strict requirements, is no longer accepting new applicants. However, you can . for when/if it reopens. .Behind the scenes, Amazon continues to invest aggressively in its logistics operations. It recently announced that it was . for a fleet of 81 aircrafts, slashing an estimated $100 billion from the top line of companies like UPS. Amazon also put in an order for .. These moves build upon the company’s long track record of reaching into its deep pockets to make large, strategic investments. Safe to say that its dominance in this arena will only grow and will continue to drive customer expectations around shipping..Walmart recently launched its own . to rival Prime, similarly making fast shipping a core benefit. Through the program, the company offers free, unlimited same-day shipping on all grocery items and other perks, like a scan-and-go service for in-store shoppers..Walmart also offers free two-day shipping for orders over $35 (no membership required) and heavily promotes its TwoDay Delivery Program among its sellers. By participating in the TwoDay program, you can gain two-day shipping tags on your listings that elevate your search rankings and increase your buy box win rate..There are three ways to qualify for two-day shipping tags: . You must have been a marketplace seller for at least 90 days and meet . before being able to apply.., Walmart’s official fulfillment partner. When you outsource fulfillment to ., you are pre-approved for Walmart’s fast shipping tags..As mentioned, this service is only available to established marketplace sellers, but new sellers can . to express their interest, suggesting that Walmart plans to roll it out more broadly. .‍.If you choose to handle fulfillment on your own, your packaging cannot be branded or include any independent marketing materials. For this reason, Walmart expressly prohibits sellers from using .. It will not acknowledge Amazon Logistics codes as valid tracking codes and will dole out a suspension if you are caught using them..Aside from two-day, Walmart is making strides with its NextDay Delivery and two-.delivery options. Its two-hour delivery service, dubbed Express Delivery, launched suddenly in April 2020. .\"Walmart has accelerated the development of the service in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, piloting Express Delivery in 100 stores since mid-April,\" . \"The service will expand to nearly 1,000 stores in early May and will be available in nearly 2,000 total stores in the following weeks.\" .Neither NextDay nor Express Delivery are currently available for marketplace sellers to leverage. It’s likely just a matter of time, though, before they are. After all, Walmart touts that next-delivery does not cost the company any more money. As it seeks to expand its marketplace reach, it will likely pursue profitable ways to help sellers offer and promote fast-as-possible shipping..<div id=\"standards\"></div>.Amazon tracks three performance metrics around sellers, which require you to:.Maintain an Order Defect Rate (ODR) under 1%, tracked over 60 days. ODR is defined by negative feedback, claims under the company’s A-to-z Guarantee, and credit card chargebacks. .Keep your Cancellation Rate (seller-canceled orders) at or below 2.5% over a 7-day period. .Keep your Late Shipment Rate at or below 4% over both 10-day and 30-day periods, for seller-fulfilled orders only..‍.If you fulfill through FBA, these metrics are moot; Amazon will take responsibility for them. If you self-fulfill, you’ll generally receive a warning for your first offense and a chance to submit a Plan of Action before your account is at risk of suspension..That said, disputing an Amazon warning or suspension notification is part art, part science. Consultants like . exist to help sellers through these bouts, because once suspended, it could take .to get reinstated. This includes instances in which a buyer falsely claims that you sold them a counterfeit item. Even when innocent, your business must present a strong case and provide the right documentation to avoid further conflict..Walmart also tracks three core metrics, although they are slightly different from Amazon’s. As a Walmart marketplace seller, you’re required to:.Keep 90-day ODR at less than 2%. ODR accounts for orders cancelled by sellers, product returns*, late deliveries and customer complaints..Keep your On-Time Shipment rate above 99%, which you can meet by confirming shipment and entering tracking information before the Expected Ship Data that is created when a product is sold..Maintain a Valid Tracking Rate above 99%, which you can meet by providing valid tracking data when you confirm shipment..‍.Walmart will typically work with sellers who fail performance standards as long as they are actively addressing the violation, but if your ODR gets too high, your account is at risk of suspension. .<div id=\"branding\"></div>.A whopping ., meaning consumers are looking for a type of product rather than a specific brand. This underscores the importance of advertising to create brand awareness and convert the sale. Partly as a result, advertising on Amazon is growing rapidly. . and surpassed $4 billion for the first time. Both search result pages and product detail pages are becoming increasingly cluttered with paid placements, which dominate result above the fold..Amazon also offers branding opportunities and services for those enrolled in its .. Perhaps the most important of these is its protections against IP infringement or inaccurate content in listings posted by unauthorized resellers. Another important benefit is the ability to create more distinctive listings using .. .While registered brands can access . for deeper insight into their customers, Amazon still owns all the customer data. Wall Street Journal recently reported that Amazon may .. You’ll therefore want to explore creative options to drive returning buyers to your own webstore (.) and build cross-channel awareness. .As a more traditional retailer, Walmart is better known for the brands it carries. There's a higher chance that buyers may search or filter for products based on brand, though a majority of searches are likely still generic. .As you might expect, Walmart is far less saturated with advertising than Amazon. Only 1.6% of its sellers currently advertise, ., indicating lower CPCs across the board. Walmart ads, in a way, can be trickier to manage. They work on a first-price auction—you pay whatever amount you bid when you won the auction, even if it's 10 times higher than the next highest bidder. Amazon, on the other hand, uses a second-bid model whereby the auction winner pays just one cent above the second highest bid..As of 2021, Walmart offers a . that serves as a much leaner version of Amazon's Brand Registry. It is more or less a ticketing system for brand owners who notice IP infringement but is a step in the right direction. Walmart's application process further helps to reduce infringement concerns by requiring proof of ownership, experience and other qualifications..<div id=\"satisfaction\"></div>.Amazon is a mature ecommerce marketplace with nearly eight times more sales than Walmart and ubiquitous consumer recognition. It has invested heavily in developing and refining a wide array of user-friendly seller tools all available within Seller Central..It can also be a cutthroat world where, as one seller put it, you “have to constantly watch your back.” Amazon can be opaque and capricious in its business dealings with sellers. .Many therefore approach Amazon with caution. While traditionally, Amazon has been treated as a business strategy all its own, today’s sellers are looking to diversify and eliminate concentration risk across any part of their operations. .Walmart has a long way to go in its technology. Walmart Seller Center pales in comparison to Seller Central, according to sellers. Aside from features, Walmart Seller Center is purportedly difficult to navigate. Performing basic tasks can be tedious, and it’s often easier to work through a third-party integration partner than to work with Seller Center directly..As a marketplace, many would agree that it’s an alluring channel with great potential. But some sellers have reported relatively long intervals between sales on Walmart and disappointment in sales volume (or lack thereof). This could have something to do with the product category; as some categories are gaining notable traction, others are still quiet and require further promotion among buyers. .On the plus side, Walmart is growing faster than ever. As demonstrated by the introduction of ., the retailer's committed to developing a more complete suite of services for marketplace sellers. And as one seller noted, “I feel my business is more welcome on Walmart.” Another said that Walmart Marketplace is the best marketplace for the cost, given its low fees and low competition. .Much has yet to be seen in this ongoing power struggle. Amazon’s massive advantage online is being balanced, somewhat, by Walmart’s foothold in retail. .For sellers, both channels have their appeal. Walmart has demonstrated that it’s in the game for the long haul and many eagerly await for it to gain even more momentum. .The path to success for sellers is unique on each platform. Amazon merchants shouldn’t expect the same type of results or user experience on Walmart Marketplace. One thing that they .bank on is continual developments throughout the next few years. Walmart still remains a great growth opportunity, and early adopters may see their businesses grow in lockstep with Walmart’s ecommerce maturity..‍.Built by online sellers who've been around the block, Zentail is today's premier listing automation platform.

Historically big box brick and mortar strategies have dominated, but this is changing in the age of impatience and instant gratification. As consumers want items more conveniently, online retail has taken hold with no semblance of anticipated decline. At the forefront of this transformation are two industry giants: Walmart and Amazon. Walmart finds itself on the side of brick and mortar with 11,718 physical retail locations worldwide. Amazon is dominating the online retail space with control of a staggering 44% of all US e-commerce sales in 2017. These equally powerful yet opposing forces seem to have come to a realization. Walmart has determined that a purely brick and mortar strategy will not suffice and there must be a major focus on expanding e-commerce. Amazon has come to the realization that a pure e-commerce play will not be as effective as a mixed approach and is working into the brick and mortar space. As each giant finds itself on opposite sides of the spectrum they seek to reach the ideal equilibrium between physical and online retail, and acquisitions have been the remedy of choice..Acquisition, Walmart, Amazon.Sims, S.\n(2018).

        "Grocery suppliers are feeling the squeeze — big-time..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.Last month, Walmart gathered some of America’s biggest household brands near its Arkansas headquarters for a tough talk. For years, Walmart had dominated the retail landscape on the back of its “Everyday Low Price” guarantee. But now, Walmart was too often getting beaten on price..So company executives were there, in part, to reset expectations with Walmart’s suppliers — the consumer brands whose chips, sodas and diapers line the shelves of its Supercenters and its website..Walmart wants to have the lowest price on 80 percent of its sales, according to a presentation the company made at the summit, which . reviewed..To accomplish that, the brands that sell their goods through Walmart would have to cut their wholesale prices or make other cost adjustments to shave at least 15 percent off. In some cases, vendors say they would lose money on each sale if they met Walmart’s demands..Brands that agree to play ball with Walmart could expect better distribution and more strategic help from the giant retailer. And to.those that didn’t? Walmart said it would limit their distribution and create its own branded products to directly challenge its own suppliers..“Once every three or four years, Walmart tells you to take the money you’re spending on [marketing] initiatives and invest it in lower prices,” said Jason Goldberg, the head of the commerce practice at SapientRazorfish, a digital agency that works with large brands and retailers. “They sweep all the chips off the table and drill you down on price.”.But this time around, Walmart’s renewed focus on its “Everyday Low Price” promise coincides with Amazon’s increased aggressiveness in its own pricing of the packaged goods that are found on supermarket shelves and are core to Walmart’s success, industry executives and consultants say..The result in recent months has been a high-stakes race to the bottom between Walmart and Amazon that seems great for shoppers, but has consumer packaged goods brands feeling the pressure..The pricing crackdown also comes in the wake of . and .. Lore now runs Walmart.com and has said one of his mandates is to create new ways for the retailer to beat everyone else on price, including Amazon..The pricing pressure has ignited intense wargaming inside the largest CPG companies, according to people familiar with discussions at.Procter & Gamble, Unilever, PepsiCo, Mondelez and Kimberly-Clark. There is no one-size-fits-all solution..“It’s dominating the conversation every week,” said an executive at one of these companies..Representatives for these companies either declined to comment or failed to respond to requests for comment. Executives inside these companies would only speak on a condition of anonymity because negotiations with retailers are confidential..An Amazon spokesperson said in an email: “At Amazon we protect low prices for our customers, every single day — nothing has changed in terms of our focus or how we operate.”.Walmart did not provide a comment..One piece of the battle, executives say, is an Amazon algorithm that works to match or beat prices from other websites and stores. Former Amazon employees say it finds the lowest price per unit or per ounce for a given product — even if it’s in a huge bulk-size pack at Costco — and applies it across the same type of good on Amazon, even when the pack size is much smaller..So let’s imagine Costco is selling a pack of 10 bags of Doritos for $10 — or $1 per bag. Amazon’s algorithm notes that one bag is $1 at Costco and, in turn, lowers the price on Amazon of a single bag of Doritos to $1..That is a great deal for customers — something that is likely driving the decision at Amazon, where an obsession with customer value dominates its strategy..But now, Amazon is selling individual items at Costco prices while not getting the same wholesale price that Costco enjoys. In short, it’s going to be really hard for Amazon to turn a profit on those goods. .When Walmart sees this, it freaks out on the supplier, industry executives say. And it doesn’t matter to Walmart that Amazon may not be getting the same wholesale price that retailers like Costco or other membership clubs receive. In other words, even if Amazon isn’t profiting from its extremely low prices, Walmart is still demanding the same bulk-rate discount applied to individual items. .“Walmart has had it explained to them by myself and others,” said one industry insider who asked for anonymity talking about private discussions. “My conclusion has been that they beat all suppliers up regardless because they need it to be a problem at the senior levels of these companies.”.In some instances, Amazon is willing to lose money for some period of time on a product it feels it has to have. Jeff Bezos’s company knows, after all, that it has to continue to increase its selection in non-perishable grocery goods if it is going to really challenge Walmart in the $800 billion category. .But, more so than in the past, Amazon is ratcheting up the pressure on manufacturers of goods that the online retailer is unable to sell for a profit, executives say. Separate from the algorithm, brands are also facing the realization that their products that are sold profitably in stores may become unprofitable online when shipping costs are factored in..Unprofitable items are known inside Amazon as CRaP products — the acronym stands for “Can’t Realize a Profit.” And Amazon is not afraid to kick off big and small brands alike. .Case in point: On a Friday afternoon last month, all Pampers diapers sold by Amazon were unavailable on the site. Industry speculation was that Amazon may have kicked Pampers off the site as part of a negotiation over prices. .Neither Amazon nor Pampers parent company Procter & Gamble would comment on whether this was the case. But the bigger point may be that senior industry executives thought such a move was even a legitimate possibility..“I’m very concerned,” one of them said. “Do all CPG goods get commoditized to 40 percent below where they’re used to being? The long-term implication is you just don’t know where the bottom is at.”.When Amazon warns suppliers that a product is pre-CRaP, meaning it’s in jeopardy of being kicked off the site for profitability issues,.it makes demands. Oftentimes, to lower wholesale prices. But that doesn’t always work, especially if a brand has the leverage of also selling into Walmart, which is still the biggest retail customer for many manufacturers..In these instances, Amazon may transfer the product to Amazon Pantry, a smaller catalogue of goods restricted to Prime Members. All Pantry orders come with a $5.99 shipping fee per box, which helps cover Amazon’s costs, if fewer than five items are ordered at one time..Another Amazon tactic is to prohibit some brands from buying ads within the site for a product that Amazon can’t make profitable on a standalone basis. Like paying for prominent placement in a store, a brand can buy ads within Amazon to promote their products. Blocking these ads is another way of burying a product..“They are playing Jekyll and Hyde,” said an executive at a large grocery goods manufacturer. “At times, it’s all about growth; at times, it’s all about profitability. They keep switching back and forth.”.Another factor: As Amazon Prime becomes a bigger part of Amazon’s business, Amazon ships more orders that consist of just one item. These orders can typically be tougher to make profitable than multi-item orders — a trend that could explain the renewed focus on profitability. .“Amazon realizes Walmart is serious,” the executive said, “and is basically asking manufacturers to subsidize their unprofitable shipping costs for them.” .What is a brand to do? There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some do give in and offer Amazon a better price if they can afford it..Some push Amazon to keep the unprofitable product, but give them a better deal on a more profitable item. .Another strategy is to stop selling to Amazon as a wholesaler and instead sell directly, or through resellers, on Amazon’s marketplace. Amazon cannot control the price of an item sold by marketplace sellers, though it can make it harder to find items that aren’t priced aggressively. .The longest-term solution, however, is perhaps the most difficult: Reimagining how a product should be designed and packaged from the ground up, specifically for e-commerce sales. That often means cutting the weight of low-price goods.since shipping costs tend to eat into a product’s profitability. (Amazon, in fact, is trying to . by asking brands to reformulate their packaging to make it easier to ship — all done via Amazon, of course.).Big brands, however, have been doing more talk than action when it comes to pursuing this solution — a fact that you can be sure Amazon has noticed..But Andrea Leigh, an ex-Amazon general manager who now runs her own brand consultancy, has come across a few examples of brands redesigning goods for e-commerce. One of them, from the brand Celsius, is an energy drink that has been transformed into powdered packets that the customer mixes with water at home..Then there’s the brand Green Works, which has sold household cleaners in concentrate form, along with an empty spray container. .“If competitors go away and you can live it out, it presents you with an opportunity where you can steal share in a relatively easy way,” she said. “Figuring out how to do online better and not getting CRaP-ed out, that’s a huge opportunity.”.Perhaps the toughest part of being a traditional consumer packaged goods brand today is that you don’t know who your customer is because you sell to them via a middleman: Retailers like Amazon and Walmart. And if you try to sell direct through your own website — which requires a different set of skills — retailers often raise hell. Yes, the same retail partners that are putting the squeeze on wholesale prices..So some of these multinational companies are dabbling with diversifying their sales channels through acquisition. Unilever, the owner of brands like Dove and Hellmann's, last year .. The vast majority of Dollar Shave Club’s sales come through its own website..Venture capitalists are betting that that deal will be the first of many acquisitions of digital-first brands that would traditionally sell their goods on supermarket shelves — though no major ones have yet followed. If they’re right long-term, however, this pricing pressure from Amazon and Walmart may be partly to blame — or thank..\n    Millions turn to Vox to understand what’s happening in the news.

        "Walmart is at war. For 30 years, they have ruled as king of all retailers. Along the way came an online bookstore called Amazon. From a humble garage in Seattle, Amazon quickly grew and expanded into other market territories. They proved to be a formidable force, launching innovation after innovation. Then it happened. In 2019, Amazon surpassed Walmart and took the crown as the world’s largest and most valuable retailer. In terms of revenue, Walmart still outranks Amazon, but the brick-and-mortar juggernaut has launched an all-out war to reclaim its title by finally charging into the digital battlefield with its own platform: Walmart Marketplace..Describing itself as the world’s largest . retailer, Walmart’s online platform opened back in 2009 for select retailers. In 2016, they expanded by inviting more 3rd party sellers, but their version of Amazon really didn’t take off until this year. According to Marketplace Pulse data, more than 25,000 sellers have joined Walmart Marketplace in 2020, bringing the total to around 60,000. This is merely a fraction of Amazon’s army of 2.5 million active sellers, but the recent growth spike along with Walmart’s well-established base of more than 265 million customers give it the potential to become a strong competitor. Below Channel Key highlights Walmart’s e-commerce battle strategy, and more importantly, how brands can take advantage of this rivalry to reach additional customers..Walmart Marketplace is like Amazon in many ways. Sellers undergo an approval process, onboard their listings, choose a fulfillment option, utilize marketplace marketing and advertising programs, and get paid. Within this basic structure, however, there are several key differences. First, qualifying to become a Walmart Marketplace seller can be challenging. While Amazon allows just about anyone to open a digital storefront, Walmart is careful about the brands they choose to sell under its name. To be approved, sellers need to demonstrate a history of e-commerce experience on other platforms, reputable customer service, a compelling product assortment, and competitive pricing. In the early days, Walmart Marketplace was an invitation-only platform. Today any brand can apply, but to earn approval is much more difficult..Walmart Marketplace offers several fulfillment options. Like Amazon’s Fulfilled by Merchant (FBM) program, sellers can opt to self-fulfill orders (upon qualification) through its Seller Center platform. Walmart Marketplace FBM sellers can display the “Free Two-Day Delivery” label on their approved listings, which is a core component to the retailer’s strategy against Amazon. Thanks to the latter, one-day and two-day shipping are now factored into the customer’s purchasing decision..Walmart seems to acknowledge the new standards set by Amazon. In February of 2020, they introduced Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS). Akin to Amazon’s Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) option, WFS sellers store their inventory at Walmart fulfillment centers. When a customer places an order on Walmart.com, WFS picks, packs, and ships the item(s) on the seller’s behalf. WFS also handles all customer support and returns for these orders. The WFS end-to-end fulfillment experience comes with access to Walmart omnichannel capabilities such as its Free & Easy Returns program. Participating items display the Free Two-Day Delivery and Fulfilled by Walmart tags for increased product visibility and improved conversion. Like FBA, the WFS cost structure includes a fixed monthly storage fee and a fulfillment price that is based on the item weight..Unlike Amazon, Walmart Marketplace has partnered with a 3. party fulfillment service to provide sellers with another option. Sellers can choose to fulfill orders through Deliverr, an e-commerce logistics service that integrates directly with Walmart Marketplace and provides pre-approved access to Free Two-Day Delivery..The primary selling point of joining Walmart Marketplace is gaining access to their loyal customers. In addition to 11,500 brick-and-mortar stores frequented by 265 million customers each year, more than 100 million people visit Walmart.com each month (according to their data). This is about half of Amazon’s monthly search traffic. To compensate for this disadvantage, Walmart emphasizes other key distinctions that may be attractive to sellers:. With far less seller competition than Amazon, it can be easier to stand out, gain brand exposure, build trust and authority, gain new leads, and convert sales on Walmart Marketplace.. Unlike Amazon FBA, there are no SKU minimums or maximums with WFS, so you can list your entire catalog of eligible items on Walmart Marketplace or manage limited inventory with a fixed threshold setting.. Walmart Marketplace provides a simpler fee structure than Amazon. The platform simply deducts a referral fee once a sale occurs (no setup, subscription, or monthly fees).. Nine out of ten Americans live within 15 minutes of a Walmart store, which makes returns and customer service easy by leveraging by the retail giant’s existing capabilities in its brick-and-mortar network..Walmart Marketplace has been around for more than a decade, but in reality it is still in its infancy. From a seller’s point-of-view, this provides both advantages and disadvantages when comparing it to Amazon. With only around 60,000 current sellers, it’s much easier to generate traffic to your listings than a platform with 2.5 million competitors. On the other hand, its marketing and advertising capabilities are quite limited. Amazon has a much larger collection of consumer shopping data that it has used with the help of advanced technology to develop an increasingly expansive arsenal of tools to target customers..Still, Walmart is no entry-level soldier in the ranks of retail. They are the former king; a retail behemoth with six decades of momentum, hungry and determined to take back the throne by shifting their forces to the e-commerce battlefield. Walmart may be the current underdog, but anything can happen. Regardless of the outcome, the true victor in this epic rivalry will be neither Walmart nor Amazon. It will be the . who profit from the ongoing challenge to create the most modern, effective, and powerful way to reach an audience; and the . who save time and money with easier, more streamlined methods of shopping..Channel Key is a full-service channel management marketplace consulting agency that has helped generate $250M in Amazon sales for retail brands around the world.

        "Amazon and Walmart are ramping up their efforts to grab market share in the $360 billion prescription drug market in the US..Today, Amazon . that Prime members can receive a six-month supply of several widely prescribed drugs, starting at $6. Many drugs are pricier but are still discounted relative to typical cash prices. And ., Walmart said it would be adding new discounts of up to 85 percent on prescription drugs purchased through its Walmart+ RX service, with an average savings of about 65 percent..The new announcements come as the retail behemoths have largely failed to disrupt the traditional pharmacy industry. Big names still dominate, with CVS and Walgreens topping the rankings by revenue. Walmart, which has a significant physical footprint for its pharmacies, comes in fifth..Amazon has yet to make a dent, not even cracking the ., and the e-commerce retailer’s ambitions have been further stymied by the fact that retail pharmacy locations have . recently relative to mail pharmacies. Though the company made waves last year with its announcement of Amazon Pharmacy—some analysts predicted that CVS and Walgreens would be hit hardest by the reveal—the company has been in the prescription drug business for years following its . for $753 million. Amazon’s lack of traction in the market is upsetting the narrative that the e-commerce company dismantles every legacy business model it encounters..That could be why a report last month from . said that Amazon was looking at opening traditional pharmacies inside its more than 350 Whole Foods locations. But nothing has come of the idea so far, as starting a physical pharmacy is expensive. Each new Whole Foods location would need about three pharmacists and five technicians, in addition to changes in store layouts..It’s also hard for Amazon to get drugs for lower prices. Most wholesale purchases are made through pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which act as middlemen, using purchasing power to negotiate rebates and lower prices from drug manufacturers. PBMs then pass on a portion of those rebates to insurers, though smaller companies and insurers have . that they’re not seeing the same savings, which are hard to measure since the rebates are often secret..Pharmacies then sell to consumers, of course, but the billing differs depending on whether the customer has insurance. If so, the pharmacy charges one pre-negotiated rate and is reimbursed by the PBM at another, lower rate. If not, pharmacies charge the customer a predetermined “usual and customary” cash rate. These rates vary widely, and because PBMs won’t reimburse pharmacies above them, pharmacies have been setting relatively high usual and customary rates. That allows companies like Amazon, Walmart, and GoodRx ...Both new plans from Amazon and Walmart allow customers to sidestep insurance altogether, but not PBMs. Walmart’s works much like a typical prescription drug plan. Customers apply for a “savings card” that looks like a prescription drug card issued by Walmart, usable only at its stores or its website. The retailer is working with a PBM, and it appears to be passing on a significant portion of the typical rebates to cash customers who would otherwise pay the higher usual and customary rate..Amazon is doing the same thing, but it's attempting to wring out more savings by sending customers drugs in bulk, reducing shipping and handling costs. Not all drugs are available in six-month supplies, and some that are cost significantly more than $6 per month. But some, including the diabetes medication metformin, are available for $1 per month. Customers can still opt to use their insurance if it ends up making the purchase cheaper..This is Amazon’s second or third attempt to disrupt health care markets, depending on how you count. Its PillPack purchase fed into the company’s robot-enhanced image—the startup distinguished itself by using robots to package all of a customer’s prescription drugs into small daily packets. Amazon also tried to upend the health insurance industry years ago when it founded Haven along with companies like Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan. That effort ended . this February..You must . to comment.",

        "Article Contents.As online shopping gains rapid popularity post-pandemic, the biggest question in the US is  “Amazon vs Walmart.” Both retail giants are coming head to head as Amazon grows faster than ever. Walmart, a brick and mortar giant, generates $559 billion annual revenue. While Amazon only generates $386 billion, it is adding over $100 billion in sales year by year. With a fierce new online retail giant as a competitor, Walmart has also been rolling out its own online marketplace incentives to catch up. .So which is the best place to sell in 2021, Amazon, or Walmart? In this article we’ll lay out the key differences between them, in fulfillment, fees, profitability and level of competition on each platform..is very easy, sellers simply sign up for a Professional plan which costs around $40 per month. Anyone can become an Amazon seller, even someone with no experience running a business. All Amazon needs is some pertinent details such as seller identity, business address, business licence, tax information and so on. After this, sellers can choose to sell on Amazon through FBA, FBM or both..Sellers can add their products quite easily to their online store, and add product details & photos. Once it’s approved, and you have shipped inventory to an Amazon Fulfillment Center, you’re officially selling on Amazon! You can send inventory via direct shipping, dropshipping, or a 3PL, all options are open to Amazon Sellers. However, you can only dropship from your manufacturer or supplier, not another retailer..Sellers also get access to Amazon Advertising, where they can pay for ads on a pay-per-click basis to promote their products on Amazon..Selling on Walmart has one key difference, you first need approval before you can sell on the .. Walmart will email an “Invitation to Sign Up” for approved sellers, and only then can they create a Seller Account on Walmart Seller Central. Unlike Amazon, Walmart has no monthly fee or charges to maintain a seller account on its marketplace. Sellers are only charged a referral fee per product. After signing up, sellers simply upload items and fulfill their orders.  .Becoming an approved Walmart seller is not as easy as becoming an Amazon seller. Walmart is more selective, and it prioritizes sellers with established businesses & e-commerce experience.  .One thing to note is that Walmart will not allow Marketplace Sellers to dropship their inventory. Only dropship vendors can do this on Walmart..When it comes to fulfillment, Amazon has a well-established and robust fulfillment network available to all Amazon Sellers worldwide –  FBA. FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) essentially takes over most of the tasks new sellers struggle with. Selling your products using FBA means Amazon will store, pick, pack, ship and even handle returns for your products. FBA is incredibly convenient and comes with fairly reasonable FBA fees, ..  .Sellers can also choose FBM, which is Fulfillment by Merchant, if they sell large-size products that they’d get better rates for using a 3PL. Sellers can even use a mix of both FBA and FBM, so fulfillment on Amazon is very flexible. .In 2020, Walmart launched its own fulfillment network called WFS – Walmart Fulfillment Services. WFS was introduced in direct competition to Amazon FBA, because it offers the same inventory management services. However, one way in which WFS falls short compared to Amazon is that .In contrast, Amazon FBA allows you to ship products from anywhere in the world..Some of the key differences between Amazon & Walmart’s fulfillment service requirements:.Amazon and Walmart both have 3 types of fees – referral fees for products, fulfillment fees and storage fees..Amazon has varying product referral fees based on the product category you sell in, as does Walmart..depending on the item type and product category. Amazon also has some other selling fees, like rental book service fees for books, or closing fees of $1.80 per item for products in categories like Books, DVD, Music, Software & Computer, Video Game Consoles & Accessories.. depending on item type and product category, and it has no other selling fees..It’s clear that when it comes to referral fees that Walmart is the better option. Walmart’s referral fees cap out at 20%, but this is also because some product types that .be sold on Walmart, can be sold on Amazon. One example of this is Custom Products. Amazon allows you to sell custom content in apparel, home decor, accessories etc., but Walmart does not.  .It will take a closer look at your product and the types of fees that will apply to see which service is really better for you..Both FBA and WFS have fulfillment and storage fees, and they vary based on product size or dimension tier. The first key difference is Amazon’s storage and fulfillment fees vary based on weight & dimensions of each product. Meanwhile, Walmart has .storage and fulfillment fees which are based on the . of the product. .Amazon calculates FBA fulfillment fees based on the weight tier a product falls in. Meanwhile, Walmart considers the total dimensional weight of a product. In this case, this means that Walmart’s fees are much lower for certain products compared to Amazon. However, for many products, the fees are nearly the same for both..In order to see fufillment fee breakdowns, you need to have a Seller account on Amazon and Walmart. Thankfully, a comparison made by Helium10  clarified these key differences, through 3  ‘example’ packages: .In this case, we can see that WFS fees are much cheaper for example package #1, but basically on par with FBA for example packages #2 and #3.  The main reason for this discrepancy is because example package #1 is an “oversize item” according to the FBA fee structure. Oversize items on Amazon have very high fulfillment fees due to the .. In comparison, because WFS looks at the dimensional weight only, the fees are lower. .Naturally, these 3 examples aren’t a sure indicator of which will be cheaper for you as a seller. For this reason . which provides the cost structure for both FBA and WFS for each product size tier. .As for storage fees, Walmart charges essentially the same storage fees as Amazon. The only difference in storage fees occurs in Q4, where Amazon charges noticeably higher storage fees. .are $0.75 per cubic foot per month year-round,  except in Q4 if a product is stored longer than 30 days, there is an additional $1.50 per cubic foot per month. .have varying amounts depending on product size tier. .As seen above, fees in Q4 for Amazon are significantly higher than Walmart, but .Once you pass that 30 day storage mark, Walmart’s storage fees in Q4 get more expensive than Amazon. .Please note, Amazon also has . that are expensive .s based on product tier, but this is in cases where inventory has been stored for 180-365 days or more..Amazon has a far bigger online marketplace than Walmart.  According to Marketplace Pulse’s latest data, Amazon hosts 1.6 million active sellers, meanwhile Walmart only has about 92,000..Amazon’s market share in the e-commerce market of US is absolutely massive. According to eMarketer, Amazon controls 38.7% of the retail e-commerce sales share in the US, meanwhile Walmart has only 5.3%, even though it has the 2nd largest share in the US after Amazon..Of course, in terms of competition, this has upsides and downsides. Amazon’s gigantic marketplace means sellers get more visibility for their products and a higher potential for conversions to sales. Amazon had 200 million unique visitors to its site in 2019, in the same year, Walmart had 138 million. Unfortunately, a bigger marketplace also means Amazon is saturated with sellers, and it is harder to climb to the top. .In comparison, Walmart is less competitive. There are fewer sellers to compete with and so its easier to climb. However, recall that Walmart is very selective in choosing sellers, which means that most of your competitors are well-established businesses with good business acumen. .Profitability is what sets Amazon apart from Walmart, due to one important difference.   On Amazon, sellers have the freedom to change their product prices to as low or as high as they want without any issues with Amazon TOS. In contrast, Walmart has some price-related rules that must be not be broken. .Firstly, Walmart automatically unpublishes products if the same product can be purchased for cheaper on another website hosted by the same seller. Second, products that are priced higher in a way that purchasing that same product on a competing website would be cheaper (regardless of seller) will also be unpublished. Both these rules include shipping costs. .In this case, Walmart’s focus on low prices means less freedom for sellers when it comes to pricing their products. On Amazon, if your product is unique and you have built brand loyalty, you can increase the price above your competitors to make more than you were previously. Undoubtedly, Amazon Sellers have more control over their profit margins than Walmart Sellers do..Of course, this is a double-edged sword, because your competitors have the same freedom. There will also be instances where competitors price their products so low it’s a price you simply cannot beat, so in this case, Walmart may offer some security. .A quick summary of the pros & cons of selling on Amazon vs Walmart: .*.– As mentioned before, dropshipping is only allowed directly from your manufacturer or supplier. Dropshipping from a retailer is .allowed..Overall, looking at the pros & cons for each marketplace, Walmart certainly has more cons than pros. Personally, we recommend Amazon FBA for new sellers. If you’re a seller with an established business and years of  experience managing it, then Walmart is perfect for you. Walmart is a good way to shift  a successful brick & mortar business to an online one. Meanwhile, Amazon FBA is perfect for someone new to e-commerce, because it allows more freedoms and leeway. .In this article we covered the key differences of selling on Amazon and Walmart. While we personally recommend sellers to go with Amazon FBA, we acknowledge that selling on  Walmart has certain benefits as well. In the end, the decision is up to you, the seller and based on what products you want to sell.

Instead, the FTC is sending these orders under a legal provision that allows it to conduct broad studies of competition. The companies have 45 days to respond..The orders require the companies to turn over internal documents and information about the factors disrupting their ability to attain and deliver goods, increased costs and prices and the steps they are taking to minimize disruptions. The FTC also wants to know how they allocate products among stores when items are in short supply..FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement that she hopes the study will “shed light on market conditions and business practices that may have worsened these disruptions and led to asymmetric effects.”.Khan, who was appointed by President Joe Biden earlier this year, has been a . and the agency has set an aggressive antitrust agenda..Amazon and Walmart did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Kraft Heinz said in an email that the company “will work with the FTC to respond to the request in a timely manner.” Procter & Gamble and Tyson declined to comment..The National Grocers Association, a trade group for independent grocery stores and their wholesalers, has pushed for stronger antitrust enforcement throughout the past year. The group praised the FTC’s 4-0 vote in favor of conducting the study..Independent grocery store owners say they have been unfairly ., leaving their stores with emptier shelves, lesser-quality products and higher prices for customers..The Grocers Association hopes the FTC study will lead the agency to “soon rein in the destructive anticompetitive tactics that have been ignored by federal agencies for decades,” Chris Jones, the trade group’s senior vice president of government relations and counsel, said in a statement Tuesday..The-CNN-Wire.™ & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

        "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday requested Amazon, Walmart, and other large wholesaler companies and suppliers to turn over information that would help study the case of supply chain disruptions, as well as record-high prices in the market..The four members of the FTC unanimously voted on Monday to launch the inquiry on the supply chain disruption, . reported. The said inquiry will give 45 days from the date they receive the order to respond according to their requests..Aside from Amazon and Walmart, Kroger and other wholesalers like C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc., McLane Co., Inc., will receive the order, . reported..Suppliers including Procter & Gamble Co., Tyson Foods, Kraft Heinz Co., are also required to turn in information.The FTC's study aims to find out if the supply chain disruptions will lead to negative impacts such as \"leading to specific bottlenecks, shortages, anticompetitive practices, or to rising consumer prices.\".\"I am hopeful that the FTC's new 6(b) study will shed light on market conditions and business practices that may have worsened these disruptions or led to asymmetric effects,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement..Khan also explained that the supply chain disruptions are \"upending\" the delivery of a wide range of goods including meat, computer chips, medicine, and lumber..To push through with the study, the FTC required the said companies such as Amazon and Walmart to give details on the \"primary factors\" that affect their company's ability to \"obtain, transport, and distribute their products.\".The said companies were also required to give specifics on the impact of disruptions in terms of delayed and canceled orders and increased cost and prices. Moreover, the companies are also expected to provide details on the affected products, suppliers, and most affected inputs..Furthermore, the companies should also reveal the steps they are taking the supply chain disruptions, and how they allocate the products in their store when they are in short supply..The FTC also asked the companies to provide internal documents about the supply chain disruptions, and strategies related to supply chains, costs, marketing, profit margins, pricing, sale volumes, and selections of suppliers and brands..The request of the FTC on companies like Amazon and Walmart came as President . hosted a meeting with CEOs to discuss the supply chain issues and inflation during the holiday season..The technology sector was represented by Samsung CEO KS Choi and Etsy CEO Josh Silverman. The grocery sector was represented by Food Lion President Meg Ham, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen, and Todos Supermarket CEO Carlos Castro..Walmart CEO Doug McMillon and CVS Health CEO Karen Lynch were also in attendance virtually. .President Biden said that he wanted to hear from the CEO how prepared they are to have the products on their shelves and how they \"innovated\" to address the supply chain challenges..The president also asked the Walmart CEO about the improvements in the rate of their goods' flow in the ports in the aftermath of the administration's response..McMillon said that Walmart saw at least a 16 percent increase in the ports nationwide in the past four weeks. The CEO added that they have a higher rate of increased flow in Los Angeles and Long Beach port, with at least 51 percent..President Joe Biden was expected to deliver remarks on how his administration will address the supply chain disruptions..However, a White House senior official said that the remarks of the president were moved until Wednesday as the chief executive wants to have \"ample time\" spent with the business leaders..This article is owned by Latin Post..Written By: Joshua Summers.Sign up for our free newsletter for the Latest coverage!.\n., ., ., ., . .\n. .\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n",
        "\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.By Moira Ritter, CNN Business.The supply chain is facing ., and container ships are heaping pollution into communities near the congested ports..The biggest offenders are, unsurprisingly, the world’s biggest retailers, according to a. Tuesday conducted by environmental organizations Stand.earth and Pacific Environment. The report shows that goods imported to the United States by Walmart, Target, Amazon and IKEA between 2018 and 2020 accounted for 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions..As of Monday, there were 84.vessels waiting off the coast of Southern California, 37. outside the Port of Los Angeles and the other 47.near the Port of Long Beach..For the communities surrounding those ports, emissions from cargo ships have long led to major health concerns..The . because of the Covid-19 pandemic and ongoing port congestion is pushing pollution levels in these communities to all-time highs, according to the report..“Until recently, the massive climate disrupting and human health harming emissions from international container shipping — and the companies that are buying their services — have sailed under the radar of public scrutiny,” the report said..As of 2021, the shipping industry accounts for almost 3% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. That’s more than the emissions from global air travel. The report predicts that if consumer demand continues, emissions will grow 50% over 2018 levels, an increase of up to 500 million metric tons of carbon dioxide..\n.Of the companies examined, Target and Amazon have played and “outsized role in the current congestion and pollution crisis” off the California coast..Amazon noted it has a goal to deliver 50% of its shipments with net-zero carbon by 2030. It also was a signatory of the Climate Pledge to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across its business by 2040..As vessels from . have idled offshore, they have brought “higher levels of asthma and cancer-associated air pollutants including particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur oxide into the port-adjacent communities of San Pedro, Wilmington, and West Long Beach,” the report states..The report estimates that Target is responsible for more than 6.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions while Amazon is responsible for 1.4 million metric tons..A Target spokesperson said the company is committed to “reducing our shipping carbon footprint as we work toward our goal of being a net zero enterprise by 2040, with net zero emissions across both our operations and supply chain.”  Target is also working with its global carriers to ensure they adhere to the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 limits on sulfur fuel for ships to help reduce emissions, the spokesperson added..Walmart, the., topped the list with the highest volume traded and the largest emissions. The report estimates that Walmart is responsible for more than 11.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions over the past two years..A representative from Walmart told CNN Business the retailer was the first to set a science-based target for emissions reduction, that the company is committed to reaching zero emissions in its operations by 2040. And two-thirds of products sold in US Walmart locations were made, grown or assembled domestically, the representative added..Ikea said it agrees emissions from ocean shipping is an important topic and needs more focus..\n.Unlike the other three companies included in the report, IKEA’s emissions have decreased over the past two years. The report estimates that the furniture retailer emitted 1.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions between 2018 and 2020. However, those emissions have followed an overall downward trend, decreasing 16% between 2018 and 2019 and another 8.5% between 2019 and 2020..In an effort to work around supply chain congestion, and in line with its strategy to reduce carbon emissions, IKEA has been transporting goods from China to Europe via rail rather than ships. This shift is one reason the retailer has seen a decrease in emissions, according to the report..“We are a big transport buyer, and we have a big responsibility to influence the ocean transport industry in a positive way,” the company said in a statement. “IKEA is committed to become climate positive by 2030, by reducing more greenhouse gas emissions than the IKEA value chain emits.”.\n.Last month, Goldman Sachs warned that backlogs at ports are likely to persist “at least” through the middle of 2022 and estimated that there was roughly . outside the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach alone..The ongoing port congestion has . as holiday shopping ramps up and consumer prices continue to rise..In October, President Joe Biden. the Port of Los Angeles would move to a 24/7 schedule, bringing it in line with the Port of Long Beach, which was already operating around the clock..Biden is expected to speak Wednesday about the supply chain crisis..The-CNN-Wire.™ & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

        "\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.Walmart’s U.S. ecommerce sales in the last quarter of 2020 increased by 69 percent year-over-year while its total sales grew only 7.3 percent. The message is clear: future growth will depend on ecommerce..Emboldened by a pandemic-driven increase in digital sales, Walmart has decided to challenge Amazon’s dominance in the ecommerce arena. Walmart is presumably the only retailer with the financial resources, logistical prowess, and size to do this..In its two-pronged approach, Walmart is trying to lure Amazon’s sellers and expand its own marketplace to international sellers. The company is reaching out individually to a few of Amazon’s largest sellers.

Those looking to expand tend to be established FBA merchants, Fifty-four percent of these sellers have more than 10 active product listings on Amazon. Many Amazon sellers have become disenchanted with the Amazon Marketplace. Some have been kicked out without explanation. Objections to Amazon’s actions often take a long time to resolve..The survey shows that those sellers interested in Walmart tend to list products in the top-selling Amazon categories such as home and kitchen, toys and games, and sports and outdoors. Walmart.com and Amazon have the same general customer base..Walmart does not charge sellers monthly fees, while Amazon professional accounts cost $39.99 per month. Walmart charges sellers a fixed referral fee per sale (typically 15 percent of the product’s sale price) plus additional fees if they use Walmart Fulfillment Services, which launched last year..While Walmart does not publicize its fulfillment fee structure, it states that the storage and fulfillment fees are based solely on the product’s weight and dimensions..Fees for Walmart Fulfillment Services are based on weight and dimensions..It is still easier to set up an account with Amazon.

The stores are crucial to the two-hour delivery service, which is primarily for produce, pantry items, household essentials, and other consumables. Two-hour service typically costs $10 on top of a standard delivery fee ranging from $7.95 to $9.95..However, Walmart waives the entire delivery fee if consumers subscribe to Walmart+, which costs $98 a year or $12.95 a month.

        "Walmart is the largest retailer in the US. While Amazon wins in pure online sales, Walmart's physical footprint dwarfs its eCommerce rival. Now with the release of ., brands and advertisers are faced with the question of how to balance these two major paid search platforms..You may be tempted to replicate your Amazon ad campaigns for the Walmart platform, but that would be your first mistake. Sponsored Products work quite a bit differently on Walmart vs. Amazon, so before you formulate your campaigns, consider the following key differences and how they might impact your bids, budgets and overall strategy.. .Over time, Amazon has offered up more and more ad placements, to the point that organic results now control a minority of first page real estate for the most common search terms on Amazon.com. Take, for example, a recent search for the term 'protein bar':.The pro-Amazon argument is that more ad real estate means more opportunity to get your products in front of shoppers. Amazon's share of US digital ad spend is . that of Google and Facebook and without a wide variety of placements emerging brands could easily be squeezed out by the big budget multinationals..The pro-Walmart argument is that Amazon is becoming pay-to-play. Generally speaking, the purpose of paid search is to drive organic performance: the increased visibility of ads bumps up brand awareness, traffic and conversion in order to fuel long-term search rank and grow your customer base. But with organic placements dwindling on Amazon's first page, brands need to keep spending more just to stay in the game..Walmart is consciously offering an alternative. T. For advertisers this is quality over quantity, keeping the focus of ad spend on fueling organic search ranking and increasing the reach of ads by reducing ad fatigue for shoppers.. .Another conscious differentiator on Walmart's part is to opt for a first price auction. Amazon ads are sold on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis: advertisers bid on their target keywords and set the maximum they are willing to pay per click, but the final CPC price is not set by the winning bidder but by the second-highest bid plus one cent (the second price + $0.01)..Walmart's auction system works similarly, but the winning bidder pays their full CPC bid (the first price) rather than the lower second price..On the surface, this would seem to suggest that Walmart's ad placements will tend to cost you more, but in practice this actually helps to level the playing field. In a second price auction, advertisers can game the system by bidding extremely high, confident that they won't have to pay the full price while blocking anyone else from winning the placement. This allows multinationals with huge budgets to lock smaller brands out of certain key terms..And that brings us to the actual prices. Amazon is the #3 destination for digital ad spend in the US (.) and all that competition over keywords drives up CPC prices. Walmart's ad platform, meanwhile, is a newer marketplace with lower competition over ad real estate. Therefore, smaller budgets can go further on Walmart.com and brands will have an easier time winning the most popular search terms, achieving a positive ROAS and driving organic lift.  .. Though ad competition is fierce, there's no question that winning paid placements on Amazon will get you more impressions. Not only is Amazon.com the largest online retailer in the US, it's also the place where . begin a product searches, meaning visibility on Amazon can drive product awareness across all channels..And yet, Walmart still beats it. Walmart.com sees only 20% of Amazon's traffic, but . – improving your standing with the country's largest retailer is never a bad thing. Because Walmart is omni-channel, digital ad spend can influence consumers through the full funnel and allow you to measure the impact of your ads directly, online and in-store..Amazon is infamous for providing advertisers with incomplete data. While it's true that the eCommerce giant has gradually exposed more data over time, the gaps and limitations have posed challenges for brands looking to better understand consumer behavior and improve their marketing strategies..So when Walmart promises 'More transparent reporting' in its Sponsored Products, it's pretty obvious who they're referring to. Already, Walmart provides data insights on ad placement performance such as desktop or mobile. That level of insight is currently lacking in Amazon Advertising. Even if their ads reach fewer shoppers, the investment is worth it if it means gaining a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the impact of digital advertising. .‍.Learn more about Amazon advertising:",

        "It goes without saying that COVID-19 had an unparalleled impact on retail. Consequently, it’s important to explore exactly how the pandemic shifted both customer expectations and customer behaviors..Some interesting findings include:.Curbside fulfillment options grew significantly. Prior to the pandemic, just 6% of the retailers in the . offered curbside. Now, 50% do..As of February 2021,68.% of those Top 1000 also offered buy online pick up in store (BOPIS)..Walmart and Target ., with Target seeing their largest percentage increase in the company’s history, and Walmart doubling their eCommerce sales..In May 2020, ., allowing them to now corner 38% of the eCommerce market (Walmart, their biggest competitor, accounts for 6%)..Retailers with online shopping options ., going from 37% market penetration to over 80% at the peek of the pandemic. While things have come down, many shoppers remain committed to their new digital habits, with online penetration remaining at a steady 48%. .This data paints a clear picture: while some retailers are still struggling to adapt and recover, others pivoted early on and have experienced significant growth in revenue thanks to their innovative responses to COVID-19. .Most of us can’t compete with retail giants like Amazon, Walmart, and Target. Yet their pandemic adjustments make useful case studies from which other brands can learn and take strategic cues..While each big box retailer had some unique approaches, there are clear overarching themes in their strategies..These retailers:.Recognized that customer loyalty was upended by the pandemic, with customers purchasing wherever they could, whenever products were available, rather than relying on their go-to retailers.Quickly offered a variety of fulfillment options, from Curbside to BOPIS to same-day or next-day (or faster) delivery .Pivoted retail locations to become fulfillment centers, or reduced floor displays to make more warehouse room to fulfill orders.Devoted additional resources to enhancing their digital or omnichannel experiences, like updates to mobile apps so that customers could check in for Curbside, or increased AI-driven product recommendations to guide customers to make additional purchases.Let’s break down each of these strategies to see how big box stores are responding to the pandemic and winning..At a time when many retailers were struggling, some retail executives anticipated a grace period where customers would be more tolerant as brands tried to adjust to the pandemic’s impacts. Unfortunately, customers did not rise to the occasion..Small businesses and restaurants seemed to be mostly insulated from these customer frustrations, but eCommerce retailers, mass merchandisers, department stores, and big box retailers found that .In fact, as . “Today's customer is in charge. They are no longer handcuffed to the mall near their home. They can browse anywhere and buy anywhere. They are calling the shots, and they will not relinquish that.”.Interestingly, customer tolerance varied by problem. Most were understanding of product shortages, but if a website or app was difficult to navigate, customers simply went elsewhere. And the number one source of customer frustration? Having to pay to ship a return. .Big box retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target recognized this and responded. Amazon began not even requiring customers to return some items, and simply issued refunds, instructing customers to keep the item..Target heavily promoted free shipping and free returns, as well as offering enhanced free shipping and return options to RedCard (their store credit card) holders. Walmart also offered free shipping and free returns, as well as scheduled pickups from home..And though customers were still inclined to go buy toilet paper wherever they could find it, regardless of brand, big box stores saw their customer base grow and many experienced incredible retention. .By offering customers what they wanted - easy checkout processes, free and simple returns, quick order fulfillment, and straightforward digital experiences - big box retailers reached new sales heights while simultaneously satisfying customers. .Amazon, Walmart, and Target were already industry leaders in fulfillment options, offering BOPIS and . but the onset of COVID-19 caused them to .Walmart launched “Express Delivery,” . They charged $10 on top of existing delivery fees for the express option, or offered a Delivery Unlimited program, which includes unlimited home deliveries for a $98 annual fee or a monthly $12.95 fee. Delivery Unlimited members paid $10 for each express delivery, rather than their delivery fees and the express charge. .Target offered “Drive Up” exclusively in their app, encouraging customers to download it. With the app, shoppers could order in the app, drive up, and a Target team member would deliver their items directly to the customer’s car. They also pushed their same day delivery service, offering new subscribers four weeks free to trial the service, or the option to pay a one-time delivery fee..Amazon, which experienced massive influxes of orders, particularly in March, April, and May of 2020, were initially caught off guard. They struggled to hit their 2-day delivery window for Prime customers, and paused shipping of non-essential items until mid-April, as they made significant adjustments to their supply chain, team member safety protocols, and . between March and mid-April. .Retailers also adjusted their store layouts. Walmart and Target built stations, even if just temporary, to house their BOPIS and curbside orders. Some store locations minimized displays and shrunk their floor space to expand their warehouses. Walmart hired thousands of Personal Shoppers who focused on fulfilling BOPIS and curbside orders quickly and accurately. .All of these adjustments enabled these retailers to put items in customers’ hands quickly, and cement their success during the pandemic..While free shipping and returns and seamless yet varied fulfillment were keys to big box retail success throughout the pandemic, none of it would have mattered if they offered lackluster omnichannel experiences..‍.In fact, the pandemic prompted more customers to shop around than ever before, . saying they researched online before making a purchase either online or in-store. Another 85% of customers say they trust online consumer reviews more than they trust brand-supplied information, making positive and frequent reviews critical for brands. .For big box retailers, COVID-19 merely accelerated these trends. They already had strong online shopping and checkout processes, with Amazon’s 1-Click experience the gold standard. .As . Sarah Nassauer and Jennifer Maloney wrote, “Before the pandemic, Walmart, Target, and many large retailers had already spent heavily to build eCommerce warehouses, mobile apps, and delivery networks….”.So when COVID struck, these retailers were already ahead of the curve. They simply had to expand some options - like Target adding Drive Up to their app - in order to meet new customer demands. .The lesson to learn here? It pays to be prepared. Digital transformation was already underway, and big box retailers saw the signs and invested, leaving them poised to capitalize on the past year’s extreme eCommerce demands..While Amazon, Walmart, and Target responded to the pandemic in a myriad of winning ways, they didn’t come out unscathed..Amazon and Walmart in particular faced public backlash from their massive profit increases yet little-to-no wage enhancements for essential employees who were risking their health to fulfill orders. Many small business owners and consumers were frustrated that big box retailers were deemed essential and able to sell things like clothes in their stores, while local boutiques were closed. .Now, ., prioritizing . and quality over convenience and cost-savings. McKinsey reports that while big box stores drove growth in consumer goods at the beginning of the pandemic, smaller brands have had more success in late 2020 and early 2021..For retailers that aren’t one of the Big 3, this is encouraging news. Retailers can compete by focusing on enhancing their digital experiences, because while the massive influx of eCommerce sales in Spring 2020 has evened out, it hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic numbers. .Smart brands will also invest in making order fulfillment fast and easy. .Aside from customer experience enhancements, companies should also focus on brand differentiators. It’s these differentiators that drive brand loyalty in today’s incredibly competitive environment. Loyalty programs are one way to do this. . are willing to recommend a brand if it has a good loyalty program, and . believe earning rewards or loyalty points is one of the most valuable shopping experience options..Another strategy is to truly live out your brand’s values. Brands that are viewed as making the world a better place outperform the stock market by 134%, and 75% of customers expect brands to make more of a contribution to their well-being and quality of life. .This emphasis on well-being extends to quality of customer service. Consumers consistently rank customer service as one of the most important factors in ensuring their loyalty, with 69% identifying it as “very important.” According to Business Wire, satisfied customers will share their experience with an average of 11 different people, helping brands with critical word-of-mouth marketing. .It’s more essential than ever that brands intentionally focus on customers - knowing them, understanding them, constantly innovating to provide them a more personalized and meaningful experience, and soliciting their feedback as appropriate. By making these adjustments, companies position themselves to differentiate and compete for increasingly elusive brand loyalty..Sarah is a nimble and creative marketing leader with 15 years of experience in a mix of agencies, B2B, and B2C enterprises.

And despite the ruthless competitive nature of their relationship, all three are currently thriving. .But over the past few years, each of these companies has been planning to venture into a completely new industry, one that's worth almost four trillion dollars and is inviting disruption:.It's the health care industry..\"Health care is overly complex, has not evolved all that much over time, and remains a frequent pain point for customers. All of these factors make health care ripe for disruption,\" Morgan Stanley analyst .It's a fact: The health care system is broken. Without health insurance, costs are astronomical--a single visit to the hospital can put the average American in debt for the rest of their life. And while insurance companies may ease that burden, their plans are complicated and give patients little control. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies have built a reputation as greedy profit mongers who care more about investors than people..Which is exactly why Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy have their sights set on health care as their next target..Here's a brief summary of where each company is currently focusing its efforts--and a look at who the real winner is..Jeff Bezos's \"everything store\" is already in full-scale attack mode when it comes to several health care initiatives. Just consider the following moves the company has recently taken:.Last year . that endeavored to tackle the enormous challenges of health care and harness its full benefits..\"By bringing together three of the world's leading organizations into this new and innovative construct, the group hopes to draw on its combined capabilities and resources to take a fresh approach to these critical matters,\" the companies said in a statement..Also last year, Amazon acquired online pharmacy PillPack for $1 billion. On the day the acquisition was announced, Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid lost a combined $10 billion in market cap..Now the company has introduced . a clinic that serves Amazon employees and their families in the Seattle area. Amazon Care claims to offer:.near-instant answers to health questions from a qualified professional (via in-app text chat);.in-app video visits with a doctor or nurse practitioner for advice, answers, diagnoses, treatment, or referrals;.in-person visits from a nurse to a patient's home or office to administer an exam, testing, or treatment; and,.prescriptions delivered right to your door..Although for now Amazon Care is a pilot program, it doesn't take a genius to see where this is headed. Amazon has developed what .Put customers first. Invent on their behalf. Test ideas internally. Test on Amazon employees before opening it up to the public..It's worked time and again, in various industries such as e-commerce and cloud computing. And now it's time for Amazon to disrupt the medical field..The world's largest retailer has also made major moves into health care..Walmart opened its first clinics several years ago, all of which were incorporated into its retail stores. But the company has now opened a new, standalone clinic in Dallas, Georgia, known simply as . The clinic's website claims to offer \"a variety of care services for affordable prices,\" including primary care, dental, and even mental health counseling..Already one of the largest pharmacy companies in the U.S., this move makes sense for Walmart. If successful, it could provide a more direct connection between health care and medicine providers, streamlining processes and bureaucracy--another major pain point for patients..And Walmart's venture into counseling could also mean big things in the long run. Mental health advocates believe offering counseling in places like Walmart can help destigmatize mental health care and make it more accessible to those who need it..Best Buy, one of the few electronics retailers to not only survive but thrive in recent years, has also recently revealed a focus on health care--although its plans differ a bit from Amazon and Walmart..At an investor meeting last week, the company announced a plan to sell more of the tech products and services that support the health industry, including fitness machines and health-monitoring assistance for seniors..Best Buy has spent over $1 billion on health-related acquisitions in the past year alone. And it recently hired Daniel Grossman, a physician and medical-product expert who also practices at the Mayo Clinic, to serve as chief medical officer (according to a .).  .As for its foray into health services, we'll have to wait and see exactly what Best Buy has up its sleeve. But the strategy follows other technology-focused companies who continue to look for alternate (and consistent) revenue streams. \"People are spending less money on stuff,\" . \"As you evolve into health care, the big opportunity is simplicity. And people trust Best Buy.\".So, which one of these companies is poised to make the greatest impact on the health care industry?.The truth is, it really doesn't matter. The key is that for the first time in a very long time, companies are asking the right questions. Questions like:.Regardless of how you feel about these three companies, the fact that they're now competing to provide solutions to these questions is a good thing. They've put the legacy health care companies on notice: Start working for the patient, or prepare to be phased out..And that makes it obvious who the real winners are in all of this: you and me.",

And he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else.”.Little did he know that after building one of the most imposing businesses (and fortunes) in history, just decades later his “.” would be contemplating the possibility of mass redundancies due to a plucky, Seattle-based tech company named after a river..In part one of this two-part series, I drew comparisons between the Walmart/Amazon battle for retail supremacy, and the Greek tale of the Titanomachy. As a refresher, the Titanomachy was a decades-long war between the powerful, older deities – the Titans – and their offspring challengers, the Olympians, in a battle for control of the universe. A worthy prize, indeed. I also pointed out that while this battle for the retail universe continues to rage on, below the surface, both companies are making moves in the FinTech arena, which are both impressive and potentially landscape-shifting:.“…there’s a layer to this battle which has gone under the radar. For years, behind the scenes, both companies have been quietly building up arsenals of FinTech firepower…. Why does this matter? Well, as . . from . picking off parts of their business models. While a non-trivial concern, the reality is that start-ups do not have the resources or scale necessary to present a truly existential threat to banks. Walmart and Amazon, however, do…”.In this piece, we’ll uncover the FinTech secrets of this titan..For all the headlines about Amazon’s imposing scale, Walmart’s size in the realm of the tactile is enough to give Amazon an inferiority complex. At the time of writing:.Walmart has a headcount of 2.3 million (they have more employees than 89 countries have citizens).Operates . across 28 countries, and.Grosses . (3x Amazon’s top line).Walmart’s heft was built on Sam Walton’s key insights into the retail sector, namely: if he focused on offering the ., he could .(which would permit economies of scale over time), giving him carte blanche to model the supply sector and retail landscape after his own designs..That thought process fueled a business model which has enabled Walmart to offer very low prices since the opening of his first five-and-dime store in 1950:.Walmart’s sales volume is colossal due to the spread of the operation and vast customer base.Decades-honed supply chain management expertise which drives efficiencies and reduces outlays.Low overhead and operational expense.Leveraging of ever-increasing size to squeeze suppliers on price.This business model remained sovereign, until the advent of the internet and e-commerce, which has stripped storefront overhead costs out of the equation and enabled the likes of Amazon to start chipping away at the supply-side economy of scale advantages..Walmart remains the only retailer with the size and financial clout to actively fight back against Amazon’s retail rout. The company’s counter-punches have been aggressive and frequent. They’ve had to be because in recent years Amazon has waded into Walmart waters to target less-affluent households..By comparison, Amazon’s average customer is . and the average annual household income of Prime members is .. Because the “.” philosophy was baked into the very DNA of the company, encroachment by Amazon into this territory poses a vast, existential risk to Walmart..“the total cart balance of our 50 identical items would be 10.37 percent more expensive if purchased from Amazon as compared to Walmart. Furthermore, Amazon was found to be more expensive in four of the five categories examined, with the widest margin occurring in the “Home Goods” segment.”.As Walmart rushes to become Amazon before Amazon can become Walmart, the impressive way Walmart has addressed the problem reminds me of a quote from Jim Collins in his bestseller “.”:.“The good-to-great companies displayed two distinctive forms of disciplined thought. The first, and the topic of this chapter, is that they infused the entire process with the brutal facts of reality. The second, which we will discuss in the next chapter, is that they developed a simple, yet deeply insightful, frame of reference for all decisions.”.While just my conjecture as an outsider looking in, it feels to me that Walmart has done both:.It has accepted the brutal fact that it is never going to beat Amazon in the online space in the U.S., but that e-commerce’s continued growth is absolutely inevitable and it needs to be a player (.), and.Management’s frame of reference for digital decisions seems to come from looking to provide solutions that combine its areas of entrenched advantage, namely its low-affluence customer base and unmatched network of stores (it has .). Examples of this are its . for online customers and upcoming ...These two forms of “.” have also driven Walmart’s FinTech strategy….Before outlining Walmart’s FinTech Power Plays, I want to let you in on a not-so-well-known “secret”: .. In fact, its record stretches back to 1999, when it attempted to purchase a small Oklahoma thrift, citing a desire to offer savings and checking accounts to its customers. That plan was ultimately thwarted by banking legislation which prohibited non-financial companies from owning banks regulated by the Fed. Three years later, though, it was back at it again, and yet again, it was stopped by powers in finance. Per the Institute for Local Self-Reliance’s reporting at the time:.“A coalition of consumer groups, unions, independent banks, credit unions, and realtors managed a legislative feat in California last month when they pushed through an 11th hour bill to block Walmart’s attempt to acquire a small bank..Walmart filed an application with state regulators in April to buy Franklin Bank of California, an industrial bank with $2.5 million in assets and three employees in Orange County. The new law prohibits non-financial firms from buying state-chartered banks..Opponents of the move argued that it could lead to dangerous conflicts of interest. Not only might Walmart use its size and power to muscle out smaller banks and credit unions, it could also deny loans to retail competitors and their suppliers. Such distortions would undermine the soundness of the banking sector and lead to ‘a dangerous aggregation of economic power’.”.Walmart protested the “.” based on its size, and since then has made few sustained attempts at similar approaches to enter banking. While the company is no longer going after banks (directly), it still realizes that by enmeshing itself into the lives of its low-affluence consumers via providing vital financial services, it can widen and deepen the moat they have around them. This has driven the formulation of FinTech plays which are working phenomenally for Walmart (so far).In 2015, Walmart took a decisive step into the FinTech sphere – making headlines for eschewing external payment solutions like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay – for its own in-house solution, which was launched in 600 stores. Walmart Pay’s app enables shoppers to transact at the register via QR code. As they approach the register, a QR code pops up on the POS screen and customers scan it to activate the service. Once the code has been read, items can be scanned as normal and when checkout is complete, the payment card associated with the Walmart Pay account is charged and a receipt issued within the app..How has it fared since launch? Well, in November last year, a Bloomberg piece updated that Walmart is “.” With 4,774 stores offering it and tens of thousands of new users signing up each day, its domination of the U.S. seems to be a ...In 2015, Walmart signed a partnership with FDIC insured bank GreenDot – a branchless digital Challenger Bank from Southern California that issues plastic prepaid cards. GreenDot does not offer credit, so only basic ID checks are required for customers to be able to receive and pay money with ease (essentially creating a checking account). This deal yielded the re-loadable, prepaid Walmart MoneyCard, which opened the floodgates for many of Walmart’s un/underbanked consumers. With the MoneyCard, holders can:.Use it for purchases everywhere MasterCard or Visa debit cards are accepted in the U.S..Deposit checks via their smartphone’s camera.Receive their wages by direct deposit from their employers.Write checks to pay rent and other bills requiring a paper check.Order personalized checks using the Walmart MoneyCard Mobile App.Pay bills for free with the online bill pay service.Send money for free to another participating card issued by Green Dot Bank (including the Walmart MoneyCard, of course).There are no overdraft fees, at all and,.Cards are registered and protected against unauthorized transactions.Walmart MoneyCard holders earn cash-back rewards when they shop, including:.3% cashback at Walmart.com.2% cashback at Murphy USA and Walmart fuel stations.1% cashback at Walmart stores.Up to $75 in cash-back rewards per reward year.All of which can be tracked around the clock in the Walmart MoneyCard App..In April 2014 Walmart launched its groundbreaking, in-store money transfer service for customers – a joint venture with Ria Financial – making money transfer simpler and cheaper for customers. This was launched in 4000 stores, promising to make the process of money transfer cheaper and more transparent for its consumer-base, and boy has it! Since then, customers have saved approximately . on fees, enabling them to keep more of their hard-earned cash in their pockets for important things (like buying groceries… at Walmart)..\nBuilding on the success of Walmart2Walmart, in May of last year the retailer, broadened the offering (in conjunction with Ria and American Express) to help consumers save more money and time, still. Now, account holders of Bluebird – a checking and debit alternative – can send money online for cash pickup at Walmart stores. The recipient doesn’t even need to have a Bluebird account, they can just stroll into a store and pick up their cash within minutes of the transfer, and the service costs the same as the standard W2W service..Not satisfied there, two months ago Walmart expanded its money transfer service across geographic borders, aiming to serve 2 billion unbanked people across the globe, in partnership with MoneyGram. Now, consumers can transfer money from 4700 US stores in 10 minutes to 200 countries (for a flat fee), with funds delivered to agent locations around the world, an international bank, or mobile wallet accounts..\nAs the VP of Walmart Services, Kirsty Ward, put it:.“There are millions of people sending money around the world to help loved ones with everyday needs or in times of emergency. Walmart2World, powered by MoneyGram helps customers get money to family and friends across the world in minutes, and the new low fees mean more of their hard-earned cash goes where it’s needed most.”.The Walmart MoneyCenters and Customer Service desks themselves have evolved well beyond the money transfer business. Now, customers can:.Cash checks.Pay bills.Make money orders.Get help preparing taxes.Sign up for pre-paid cards, and.Avail themselves of Walmart.com Pay with Cash.Walmart has invested heavily in improving conditions for workers since CEO Doug McMillan took over in 2014. Over the last two years, the company completed a $2.7 billion plan to do so, including wage raises and additional training. While it’d be lovely to think this was just out of the kindness of their hearts, there was, of course, a sound bottom-line incentive to the moves:.happier, more stable, better-trained staff = better customer experience &.more money in the pockets of its associates means they can spend more at Walmart (just like how Henry Ford’s wage raises enabled his employees to afford the cars they manufactured)..Heading into the Christmas week last year, Walmart announced a partnership with fintech start-ups Even and PayActiv, to provide a suite of tools for “.” for its 1.4-odd million associates in the U.S. The company’s Chief People Officer, Jacqui Canney, noted:.“Traditional approaches to workforce well-being often focus solely on physical health, but we know from listening to our associates that financial well-being is just as important. We’re investing to give our people . that help provide more stability in their lives, which we believe will empower them to be all they can be when they are at work serving our customers.”.This new tool will help associates with planning ahead for bills and savings goals, plus how much they have leftover for spending. Walmart has offered to cover the entire cost of financial management tech for both hourly and salaried associates and will ensure associates can use Instapay up to eight times per year for free (costs will be subsidized if associates need to use Instapay more than eight times in a year). The financial management and . will be available to all Walmart, Sam’s Club, and Walmart e-Commerce associates..Since 1950, Walmart has understood the needs of their consumer at a visceral level..\nThe move into money services can be compared to the bread at a restaurant – it’s negligible revenue for them. The broader goal is defensive action against the approach of low-priced consumer goods competitors by building up an arsenal of products on the consumer side; every Walmart customer globally is an Amazon customer that could be taken away. Walmart’s desire, much like Amazon’s, is to become the nucleus of a person’s life in all aspects – groceries, personal and home goods, and now financial services..While competing against the Amazon flywheel has been an uphill battle for Walmart, I honestly don’t think it’s beyond the realms of possibility to see Walmart “win” against (or at least not lose to) Amazon – it’s not easy to belt North America with physical locations, after all..\nOriginal Source: .\n                                                                        Elevate your process .to the next level. with Automation\n                                             .Recommendations.\n                        Simplify Accounts Receivables with NetSuite and RadiusOne                     .Abstract.\n                              NetSuite is a new generation, cloud native ERP that has seen tremendous adoption…                           . .\n                              8 min                           .\n                        Hackett Study: Building a Top-Performing Customer-to-Cash Process                     .Abstract.\n                              This e-book outlines the four key ways to achieve customer-to-cash process excellence.

        "Amazon surprised us all a few weeks ago with its . beyond Whole Foods. The Whole Foods relationship has not been outstanding, and the new stores will offer a cheaper, expanded inventory of food and personal care in an attempt to gain customers that aren’t sold on the Whole Foods way of life. The more traditional grocery store is Amazon’s attempt to “cover critical gaps.”.But Amazon isn’t the only threat to traditional grocers: . has earned it a 21% share of the grocery market. By comparison, Amazon and Whole Foods combined are only about 4%. Walmart has focused on making shopping easier for customers in every channel, introducing mobile updates to more easily navigate each store and developing a mobile app “list” feature that modernizes the classic paper grocery list. . in dozens of cities across the country, appealing to those who prefer to shop online..In the face of changing market dynamics, how do you make sure your brand is always looking toward the future? Amazon, Walmart and other big-box stores clearly see the value in traditional grocery marketing and using new technology to gain that share. Here, we take a look at what these bigger industry players are doing across online and offline and how you can stay competitive..Part of Amazon’s shift to physical spaces over the past few years is because .—the store has essentially outgrown itself. Since it’s getting harder to expand online, it has to go elsewhere. As Amazon adds more physical space, brands like Target and Walmart are also changing the way that consumers shop. Target is ramping up its digital options, and Walmart’s website traffic outpaces all other big-box stores, but ..  .When it comes to grocery, all of these players see opportunity in a huge market. Amazon is still a relatively small player, but the grocery industry is worth $830 billion. Amazon captured about 3% of that in 2018, so there’s a lot of room for growth, and they know that a physical presence can help..And the.. Only 15% of people buy their groceries online, 77% prefer to pick out their own groceries, 32% prefer to go to a particular grocery store and 30% like to have control over picking the quality of their fruits and vegetables.

It has focused on . frees up time for associates to assist customers out on the floor, and the use of robots to take over time-consuming tasks like restocking shelves, moving misplaced products and monitoring inventory.

The same goes for big brands like Walmart and Target..To keep up with these players, you need to:., particularly in-store. Amazon is coming, and Walmart is here to stay.

Some are doing very well, but data must continue being used strategically..In a panel at ., Freshly Co-founder and CEO Michael Wystrach commented that “In its most simplified form, data is information. And for us, it’s information on our customers.” Freshly is a grocery and food delivery start-up, and its technology innovations can serve as a good example for those in the grocery retail space..Freshly collects information to make its products better for customers, adjusting based on attributes like taste preferences and recipe ratings. What’s powerful about this approach is that when data is used properly for the customer, it delivers the intrinsic value that those customers are looking for. It improves the quality of Freshly’s product over time..Collecting data is not enough, though. Most traditional grocers are conscious of data hygiene, but there need to be more concerted efforts. Grocers have some information about their customers, but it is often outdated..For example, many grocery store loyalty members use old landlines as their “main phone number.” Not only is that an inaccurate piece of data as they likely have switched to cell phone use over time, it also precludes you from reaching people on a relevant channel.  .Getting customer information right is the first step, and then it’s about continuing to focus on identity resolution.

They also have to provide correct tracking info for shipments at least 99% of the time. In other words, you should have impeccable seller feedback to start selling on Walmart..Having an immaculate seller profile is only part of the story.

Founded by homesteaders and ranchers in the late 19th century, it enjoyed boomlets as a coal town and a station along the Milwaukee railroad, but the coal tapped out and the train shut down, and the town’s population has now sunk below 2,000. Its Main Street is lined with homages to its frontier past: silhouettes of cowboys painted on boarded-up windows; dust-covered wagon wheels in otherwise empty storefronts; a noose dangling from “the hanging tree,” which a plaque explains was used to execute three cattle rustlers and two unlucky bystanders, cattle rustling being “considered one of the lowest forms of crime.” With a lone traffic signal flashing red, it just makes the cut for being a one-stoplight town. Roundup is, in short, just about the last place you might expect to become a nexus of international e-commerce..But the geography of Amazon is strange: more than . of warehouses, distribution centers, and sortation depots located mostly in exurban sprawls and industrial zones, out of sight of the millions of customers who receive its goods on their doorstep. Even by Amazon’s standards, Roundup is an oddity. There’s no fulfillment center, Amazon’s term for the enormous warehouses where it stores and dispatches goods. In fact, there’s no official Amazon presence of any kind. Instead, Roundup is home to a growing industry of prep centers, businesses that specialize in packing goods to meet the demanding requirements of Amazon’s highly automated warehouses. .It all started in 2015. Kristal Graham, 39, had moved to the area ten years earlier to work on a ranch, but when her brother died, she turned to Amazon to sell off his books. She soon found herself sucked into the world of Amazon Marketplace, the company’s platform for third-party sellers that now represents the majority of goods sold on the site. Though she had exhausted her supply of books, she found she could buy all manner of goods (razors, K-Y Jelly, first-aid kits) from other retailers and sell those on Amazon for a profit, too. .This sort of arbitrage is common and has helped Amazon both expand its catalog and sap its competitors. It’s hard for companies . to refuse to sell on Amazon or for competitors like Target to lure customers away with steep discounts when someone like Kristal can just buy their wares and resell them at a markup. Amazon has made buying stuff so frictionless and habitual, delivery so fast — and for Prime members, free — that many shoppers . checking prices anywhere else..But Amazon only accepts goods that are packaged a certain way. Products need to be made ready for the automated gauntlet of the fulfillment center. Old barcodes and prices need to be covered up and new ones added. Glass needs to be bubble wrapped. Loose items need to be bagged. As Kristal’s business grew, she needed help with all this unboxing and re-boxing, so she started looking for a prep center. There were about 15 at the time, she says, mostly in New Hampshire, Oregon, and Delaware, which have no sales tax. That way, sellers can enter the address of their prep center when they buy from Target’s website and pad their margins by a couple percent. Montana has no sales tax either, Kristal mused, and there wasn’t a single center in the online directory. Sensing an opportunity, she decided to give prepping a try. She chose a name — Selltec — and put it up on the directory, too. .Soon goods were arriving from Walmarts and Targets across the country, bought by sellers as far away as the Philippines. Kristal expanded to her garage, then to an abandoned Ford dealership on Main Street, then to a warehouse last used to pour concrete for fracking wells. She hired ten, then 20 people. But the flow of goods had become a flood. The used books were a particular problem, with all their finicky stickers that needed removing, and thousands were arriving every day. She was working 15-hour days, and customers were complaining about slow turnarounds. “There was no guide to how to do a prep center or anything like that,” Kristal says, sounding exhausted just recalling the memory. “It was basically winging it.”.Kristal wasn’t the only person who, when asked to describe Roundup, went with “gossipy,” which is to say small — a place where everyone knows everyone, for better and for worse. Kristal had hired friends and family to handle the onslaught of packages, and fissures began to emerge. They cracked open one day in 2016. Kristal had hired a friend, Linda McAfee, whose grandson was dating Kristal’s daughter. They broke up, and it was bad. Kristal confronted her friend about it, and it grew heated. Linda says she quit; Kristal says she fired her. “I was never meant to be a boss,” Kristal says. “I shouldn’t have ever been a boss.”.It was this schism that caused prep centers to proliferate in Roundup, because shortly after, Linda went into business for herself. She had moved to the area when her husband got a job in a nearby mine. At 59, she’s both laconic and blunt, someone for whom, in her words, “stuff just flies out of my mouth, I don’t care.” She put up a shingle as MT Prep ‘n’ Ship Pro and started getting deliveries to the shop on her property..From there, Amazon prepping started to spread through Roundup as fast as a rumor. First, Linda’s neighbor told her another resident, Jill Johnson, had heard about her new gig and wanted to learn the ropes. Linda tried to fend her off, saying she was too busy. But Jill — who’d moved to Roundup from northern Florida after visiting to help her friend herd cattle — was determined. She’d just been laid off from her state job due to budget cuts and needed the work. “Okay, send her in,” Linda told her neighbor, relenting. Jill apprenticed in the shop, and they became fast friends..Soon Jill needed more space to store all the packages . was getting, so she drove down Roundup Road to the outskirts of Billings to buy a shed. She told the woman selling sheds what she needed it for, and that woman, Chris Redger, thought it sounded like a good side hustle. So Chris made a website called Rolling “R” Prep and Ship and set up a prepping operation in her store’s side room, which is now stacked with inflatable Santas, cans of chili, and leave-in conditioner sent in from Walmarts, Targets, REIs, and Big Lots, all destined for Amazon. .Not long after, it was time for Jill to help a nearby ranch bring cattle down out of the mountains. She would have, at best, limited cell reception: “The first time I felt absolutely alone was up there,” she says, her eyes bright with excitement. “Nobody can hear you scream, nobody can, and you’ve got bears and mountain lions, and you learn to trust your horse.” (Jill loves herding so much she made a photo of the ranch the backdrop of her prep website, Big Sky Prep & Ship.) She needed a house sitter to receive incoming packages while she was away, so she turned to Sandi Green, a bubbly former bank teller who was working from home doing customer service for a financial firm. Jill warned her that she got an unusual number of deliveries, but didn’t say why. .“I had no idea!” Sandi says. Soon, the hundreds of arriving boxes had filled the porch and she was searching for tarps to keep off the rain. .When Jill returned from the mountains, Sandi asked her what her business was. Sandi moved to Roundup to care for her ailing father who had since passed, and she was now living with her mother, who was recently diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Her job let her work from home, but the hours made it hard for her to get away to drive her mom to doctors’ appointments an hour away. She jumped into prepping with chipper efficiency, taking the name Prep N’ Ship 406 and setting up a workspace in her garage with fastidiously arranged bags, tape, and labels..And so it went. There are now nine women in the preppers’ group chat, soliciting advice and swapping tips on how to best package goods for Amazon. Several more are scheduled to apprentice. Between Selltec and the splinter group, every day Roundup receives 3,000 to 4,000 Amazon-bound packages — about double the number of people who actually live there. .The preppers are one part of a vast, informal, and mostly hidden workforce that stocks Amazon’s shelves. The majority of goods sold on the site come from third-party sellers, many of whom got their start going to brick-and-mortar stores looking for products to buy and resell. But the Amazon platform is designed to pit sellers against each other in competition, and as more sellers joined — there are now over ., according to one recent count — margins vanished. Some arbitrageurs adapted by . to far-flung stores to find goods, but the emergence of other e-commerce platforms presented another opportunity: sitting at a desk, buying goods online, and sending them to Amazon. .In the last several years, sellers have designed software to scrape sites and find products that can be sold at a profit. Tactical Arbitrage is one of the most widely used. Developed in 2015 by an Australian reality TV producer named Alex Moss who’d started selling on Amazon to fill the gaps between gigs, it automates much of the process. “I wanted to be able to basically point a piece of software at an entire online retail store and have it scour the catalog and compare it against Amazon’s catalog and spit out where the arbitrage opportunities were after Amazon had extracted their fees,” he says. .The missing link was the prep center: someone needed to receive all those deliveries, make sure the products were in good shape, and repackage them according to Amazon’s specifications. Amazon sellers started to recognize the need and set up prep centers in sales-tax-free states like Oregon and Montana. .Prep centers, automated software, and Amazon’s logistics network let arbitrage globalize. Now someone sitting in Ontario or Manila or Ljubljana can buy a hundred toasters from a Target warehouse in San Bernardino and send them to a prep center in Roundup and on to Amazon, which might automatically divide the toaster shipment between fulfillment centers in, say, Illinois, Kentucky, and Utah based on projected demand, before shipping the toasters to smaller local warehouses and finally out to customers. Many sellers now have about as much relationship to the goods as commodity traders to do pork bellies, just directing goods from one company’s warehouse to another. .“I’m basically moving inventory from one warehouse, to my fulfillment center, and then to Amazon to a third fulfillment center, and then to finally being sold to some customer at the end point,” says Chris Grant, a seller based in Orlando who just contracted with a prep center in Montana. “Which when you kind of take a 50,000 foot view of it, it kind of seems really inefficient.”.The women in Roundup are mostly bemused by their role in this system. They did not expect when they came to Roundup to be a way station on a highway of thousands of consumer goods. Jobs here of any sort are hard to come by, much less ones that give them the flexibility to go herd cattle, or care for ailing family, or work from an off-the-grid house miles from town. .Unlike many people who have found a niche feeding Amazon’s viciously competitive marketplace, the prep center women are welcoming to newcomers. Amazon sellers will engage in . to undercut their rivals in selling $5 socks, but the preppers have as many customers as they can handle anyway, so they’re happy to pass on inquiries to whoever’s new. .“She’s the matriarch,” Sandi says, pointing to Linda, when I meet them and Jill at the Busy Bee Cafe for pie and coffee. Linda groans. .“I call her the leader,” Jill adds. Linda’s wince grows. “She mentored me. And, I asked her, I said, ‘Why would you help me?’ And, she goes, ‘Jill, there’s no competition, there’re so many sellers out there.’”.“Pay it forward,” Linda says..Each item prepped and shipped nets the women a dollar. If the items are small and the preppers work fast, they can make good money. Sandi, who tracks her prepping in a spreadsheet on her desk, calculates that she made $49.55 per hour bagging 353 miniature animal toys the day before. Their income drops if they have to prep, say, strollers or televisions, but the work is flexible and still pays better than most of the jobs available in the area. .“The jobs we get here are so close to almost minimum wage,” Linda says. “And it really doesn’t cost a lot to start a prep. I mean, you started with one printer.” .Servicing Amazon sellers is more stable than actually selling on Amazon, and the preppers have seen plenty of new customers go quickly bust. They speak fondly of the ones who have managed to stick it out, talking about who just had a kid, whose business is growing fast, who’s looking to quit their day job. Jill has had clients invite her to visit them in Greece and Slovenia. Linda works with clients in Australia, Canada, and Malaysia. A seller from Philadelphia actually flew out to inspect Linda’s operation — “If you’re expecting a big warehouse with little robots running around, you’re going to be disappointed,” Linda says, laughing, though she admits she considered putting out a Roomba — but such in-person contact is rare. .The sellers are all elsewhere. The preppers are the ones who see the products up close, checking that they’re in good shape and packing them to Amazon’s specifications. All manner of goods pass through their shops. .“Could be food products, clothes, toys,” Jill lists. .“I have, at my age, learned that there are things out there I never knew existed,” Linda says, ominously. .“You wouldn’t believe it, you can get anything on Amazon, you know that,” Jill says. .“My goodness, yes,” Linda agrees..Like what, I ask.  .“Linda, say it,” Jill says, eagerly. .“Say it, Linda” Sandi urges. Linda hesitates. .“The rainbow condoms! The ones that light up. I was like, ‘Oh!’” .It turns out they weren’t thinking of the rainbow light-up condoms at all, but actually some other sex toy. “I didn’t know about the condoms, Linda,” Jill says..With the shoes, inflatable Santas, and sex toys repackaged, the preppers log onto Amazon, which tells them the fulfillment center to which they’ll send the products. The end result is a bizarre, looping supply chain. Some hair conditioner might get sent from a Walmart warehouse in Grantsville, Utah, to Roundup, then from Roundup to an Amazon fulfillment center in Joliet, Illinois. Finally, Amazon sends it out to a customer. .Or maybe it doesn’t. Maybe another seller buys the item and sends it to .The preppers are constantly getting packages from Amazon, which they unbox and repackage and send back to Amazon. .This is what’s called an Amazon flip. Sometimes it happens when one seller buys something from another seller who isn’t using Prime shipping, then marks it up and sends it back to Amazon in the hopes that the Prime designation will cause the algorithm to give them better billing. Other times, sellers will buy products from Amazon when the price drops, then send them right back. .Customers, of course, have no idea any of this is happening: they just see the magical efficiency of their inflatable Santa appearing the day after they clicked on it. But the preppers have a better view of the flow of goods, and to them it sometimes seems absurd. “My thought was always, ‘If Amazon knows this person is buying it, why don’t they just add it to their inventory?’” Linda asks. “Instead of shipping it, why not just move it across the warehouse?” .After coffee, I drive up the road three minutes to Selltec. It’s a much bigger operation: a beige warehouse sitting in a dusty lot, a delivery truck parked out back. It’s dim inside, and Kristal sits at a desk in front of towers of boxes, examining inventory lists displayed on her monitor. .She’s less upbeat about the business. She regrets falling out with Linda, and scaling up has brought new challenges. Right now, she’s barely profitable after leasing the space and paying workers, even just minimum wage. It takes long hours just to keep up with the never-ending stream of goods. Like the others, she’s more concerned with staunching the flow of Amazon-bound products than courting new customers. “We definitely went through our highs and lows,” she says — inventory piling up, customers complaining, working from seven in the morning to nine at night. “We went from having way too many clients to finally shutting off our clients. It was a learning curve, a . learning curve.” .She thought she’d never fill up the warehouse, and now products are stacked in the loading bay. We walk down an aisle: televisions, biochemistry textbooks, popsicle makers, power drills, Lego sets piled in Toys R Us shopping carts, and many, many pairs of shoes. They’re coming in from Targets, Walmarts, and Barnes and Nobles in Waco, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, and Minneapolis. “It’s amazing how much this stuff travels around the world,” she says..I ask her if it ever seems strange that all this stuff is just cycling around from warehouse to warehouse. \t.“It is strange,” she says, as we pass towers of body butter. “And it amazes me, if somebody actually thought about how many warehouses or how many people’s hands touch their product, it would creep them out.” .But no one thinks about that, and why would they? Amazon has designed the sleekest, most efficient consumer gratification interface ever devised: just a click on a screen or a command to Alexa and an item arrives. It’s what allows the whole arbitrage ecosystem to exist, that the ease and speed outweighs the effort of Googling other options, to say nothing of going to a physical store. .“It’s the convenience, 100 percent,” Kristal says. She gets the appeal. There are only two grocers in Roundup, both very small; several shuttered buildings along Main Street appear to be memorials to general stores, with dusty tins in the window and dioramas of settler women in floral dresses. .“We are so rural. You have to drive to Billings to get most things,” she says. So she ends up shopping on Amazon all the time, even just to get dog food. Knowing what she knows, she tries to remember to check the price, but sometimes even she can’t be bothered. .\n.\n.\n.\n",

Amazon ., and two years ago, the company said regular drone deliveries were mere months away. Recent reports, however, have hinted that Amazon Prime Air’s progress has slowed down significantly..In an emailed statement, Amazon told GeekWire it “will continue to take time to create the right technology and infrastructure to safely deliver packages to customers.” .Today’s announcement about the first delivery hubs in Arkansas comes five months after Walmart . and signed a contract that expanded the companies’ .. (The amount of investment was undisclosed.).“When we invested in DroneUp earlier this year, we envisioned a drone delivery operation that could be quickly executed and replicated across multiple stores,” Tom Ward, senior vice president of last mile at Walmart U.S., said in a news release. “Opening our first hub within months of our initial concept showcases DroneUp’s ability to safely execute drone delivery options with speed.”.The first hub is based at a Walmart Neighborhood Market in Farmington, which is part of a larger metropolitan area in the northwest corner of Arkansas. The next two hubs are planned nearby at Walmart stores in Rogers and Bentonville..“Teaming up with Walmart to launch three delivery hubs marks a significant leap forward in the broader use of UAS [unmanned aerial systems] to provide last-mile consumer delivery services and supply chain efficiency operations,” DroneUp CEO Tom Walker said..DroneUp is at least as visible as Walmart in the delivery operation: Customers first check their eligibility on the ., based on their street address. If they live in the vicinity of the drone hub, they can shop online for a limited selection of deliverable goods on the website, then pay a shipping charge on the order of $10 to get the goods delivered via an airdrop..The shipments — limited to a total of 5 pounds each — are packed up in boxes and sent out from the DroneUp hub located next to the Walmart store. A flight operator monitors the camera-equipped drone’s progress from a control tower erected at the hub. That avoids the tangled regulatory issues that would be raised by flying a drone beyond the operator’s line of sight. Deliveries can be made in as little as 30 minutes, and the hub’s operations are designed to support multiple flights per hour..Drone delivery service is available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. CT, weather permitting..DroneUp says it’s working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure the safe operation of drones in the national airspace, and has more than 190 active waivers and authorizations to support its flights across the U.S..The company says its system provides “a safe, fun and convenient way for Walmart shoppers to get smaller packages delivered by drone directly to their homes as quickly as 30 minutes from the time of order.”.In the years ahead, Walmart aims to become the leader in drone deliveries, thanks to its network of more than 4,700 U.S. stores. Theoretically, each store could host a hub for neighborhood airdrops. But to be competitive, the per-delivery price will almost certainly have to be less than $10, and the restrictions governing remote drone operations will almost certainly have to be relaxed..The FAA is still. that will have to be in place for widescale operations involving autonomous delivery drones..Over the past several years, Amazon has tested drones in . . and just across the U.S.-Canadian border in ., and it established drone development teams in ., ., . and ..

There’s no doubt that Walmart pressures suppliers for the lowest possible price. But once the products are in the stores, both Walmart and the chosen suppliers’ interests are well aligned — to sell as much as possible of the stocked items. It costs money to build stores and ship products to them. More important, choices are necessarily limited in a physical store. So Walmart wants to move as much of the merchandise it decides to sell as possible. Having chosen a supplier and negotiated a deal, there is at least some degree of temporary commitment by Walmart to the vendor..By contrast, Amazon — with no stores and an IT infrastructure that makes the cost of adding items to sell close to zero — doesn’t care . you buy, or even which of their online partners you use, as long as you buy the product through Amazon. Take books, the focus of the recent conflict. Walmart stocks a relatively small selection, so it wants to move the specific books it offers. Walmart’s interests line up quite nicely with the authors and publishers it promotes. Amazon stocks everything (except apparently now books published by Hachette), so it doesn’t care which particular book you buy. Simply put, Amazon has less incentive to make any specific supplier successful. To Walmart, for books or anything else, selling a million units of one item is great; selling one unit of a million items is impossible in its physical stores. For Amazon, who cares? That’s why relationships with suppliers, always contentious, will be particularly problematic at Amazon, especially when Amazon controls so much of the retail market share..Some believe that . are the new model in an Internet age of offshoring, outsourcing and computer-monitored work.

        "Workers across the pandemic’s front lines plan to strike together this Friday, May 1, on International Workers’ Day, to protest what they say are unsafe conditions and a lack of protection from their employers..Whole Foods, Amazon, Target, and Instacart workers are striking on May 1st .— Michael Sainato (@msainat1) .The May Day General Strike will unite employees at Amazon, Whole Foods, Instacart, Target, Shipt, FedEx, and Walmart in a single, sprawling effort. According to a press release . by ., workers—mostly non-unionized, given their employers’ notorious union-busting reputations—will call in sick or walk off the job during their lunch break, picketing outside their warehouses and storefronts.

(Amazon denies Smalls’ dismissal was because of the protest and insists he was terminated for “putting the health and safety of others at risk.”).Tomorrow’s activism comes after a string of protests held by workers at Amazon, Instacart, Shipt, and Whole Foods over the last two months, whose employers have seen unprecedented profits as staffers on the ground stock shelves and run deliveries.

What’s true is that masks, temperature checks, hand sanitizer, increased time off, increased pay, and more are standard across our Amazon and Whole Food Market networks already. Our [500,000] employees are doing incredible work for their communities every day, and we have invested heavily in their health and safety through increased safety measures and the procurement of millions of safety supplies and have invested nearly $700 million in increased pay. Working globally with our teams and third parties we have gone to extreme measures to understand and address this pandemic with more than 150 process changes to-date.”.“Statements made by this group misrepresent the full extent of Whole Foods Market’s actions in response to this crisis and do not represent the collective voice of our more than 95,000 Team Members. Along with increased pay and benefits for Team Members in our stores and facilities, we have implemented enhanced cleaning protocols, social distancing and crowd control measures, we require temperature screenings and face masks for in-store workers, and in addition to providing face masks, we offer gloves and personal face shields for added protection. We are auditing all of these practices on a daily basis to help protect the health and safety of our Team Members, which remains our highest priority.”.“We remain singularly focused on the health and safety of the Instacart community. Our team has been diligently working to offer new policies, guidelines, product features, resources, increased bonuses, and personal protective equipment to ensure the health and safety of shoppers during this critical time.

These include cleaning checklanes after each guest transaction and rotating the use of checklanes for deep cleaning, installing Plexiglass partitions at checklanes, actively monitoring, and when needed, metering guest traffic and implementing overhead audio messaging reminders, to name a few. With the safety of our guests and team members in mind, we continue to actively monitor the situation and make adjustments, as needed. . . .

        "The future of retail will be a combination of both online e-commerce and a brick-and-mortar retail presence – as recent moves from both Walmart and Amazon have shown, including today’s back-to-back announcements from the two rivals, which sees Amazon buying a chain of popular grocery stores with a., and ...Walmart is the only retailer with the size, scale and funds to take on Amazon, and it’s been making aggressive moves to compete with Amazon’s online business for years. Amazon, on the other hand, has been trying to figure out how to merge brick-and-mortar stores into its world of online shopping..The question is, which retailer will figure out the perfect mix of online and offline, and get there the quickest?.As of late, Walmart been targeting Amazon’s Prime business – ., without requiring an annual membership, for example. The move hasn’t been lost on Amazon, which in turn has gone directly after the Walmart shopper, by making it easier for lower-income consumers to .on its site. It even ., arguing that a Prime membership is not a luxury, but a need..The truth is, Amazon needs to capture the Walmart shopper as it has saturated the middle to high-end of the market with Prime memberships; approximately 60% of U.S. households now have Prime, with lower-income households the only place . stateside..Beyond its Prime cash cow, Amazon has also made moves to better tackle the grocery business – a tough area to compete as an online-only retailer, given the need to keep fresh items cold, and others frozen. Amazon has slowly ramped up in this area over the years via its delivery service ., but it has not been able to widely scale grocery deliveries due to the logistics and economics (or “.” more colloquially) involved with delivering perishable items..Here, however, Walmart has an advantage. It has stores within 10 miles of 90% of American shoppers, and has . that lets online customers place orders online to pick up curbside at their nearest store. It’s even ., to make the process easier..Amazon, on the other hand, is still a relative newcomer to brick-and-mortar retail, compared with Walmart. Though it just opened its own drive-up grocery pickup service in Seattle, many of its effort in brick-and-mortar feel more experimental..For example, it’s trying out . in major markets around the U.S., which also double as a gadgets showcase as well as a test of using online purchase data to inform store inventory selections. It’s also testing a new smart convenience store format with ., which could give it another angle into the grocery business..But Amazon doesn’t have the wealth of institutional knowledge about physical retail, much less real-world grocery stores, like Walmart does. That’s why it makes sense that it’s today making a huge grab for a grocery retailer like Whole Foods – not only does that give Amazon the edge when competing against the likes of delivery startups like Instacart and Shipt in home grocery delivery (in fact it now owns a part of Instacart, .), but it also gives Amazon a nationwide retail footprint to take on Walmart in grocery pickup..As Amazon tries to figure out retail stores, Walmart is learning how to leverage its existing brick-and-mortar retail stores as a means of pulling customers away from Amazon. Walmart today is . in order to lower the ticket price, and it’s now . who can drop off online orders as soon as the next day..What both retailers understand is that shopping will not fully transition online – at least not in the foreseeable future; nor will it operate entirely offline, either. It needs to be a mix. There are times when people still want to shop out in the real world – whether that’s because they like the experience of seeing products in their hand, because it can be more convenient or even just quicker to just shop in a store at times, rather than searching a website and waiting for delivery..While Amazon is putting up stores – and now buying a whole host of them through Whole Foods, Walmart is figuring out how to make its online catalog more competitive. Ahead of .it’s been making strategic acquisitions in one of the fastest-growing categories of online shopping – apparel – in addition to having beefed up its tech team by spending ., led by Marc Lore..Lore, of course, is the entrepreneur crazy enough to take on Amazon not once, but twice – first with Quidsi (Diapers.com’s parent company), and then Jet. And Jet’s innovation in exposing the underlying logistics of online shopping through its “Smart Cart” technology – which rewarded shoppers with savings for buying from nearby warehouses, or shipping items together, among other things – has since been translated to Walmart through the new “Pickup Discount” program..Both systems approach the problem of bringing the costs of e-commerce down by allowing the customer to make choices about what they’re willing to do to lower item prices. In Walmart’s case, those choices are more about how to bring its retail stores into that equation..In addition, through its Jet.com subsidiary, Walmart is snagging online businesses that can help it better compete with Amazon in areas where it may lack inventory. Jet acquired . a Zappos competitor called ., and clothing retailer ., while its parent Walmart just last month . outdoor retailer Moosejaw, which also has physical stores..Several of these moves are about Walmart expanding its position in apparel, now the largest category for online retail, according to .. Amazon has been approaching this category from another angle – making its own-label fashion items, including . clothing, ., and men’s shirts, for instance..However, apparel sales are still challenging online, due to sizing issues, fit, and the high cost of managing returns. As Walmart inches into apparel through its combination of offline/online clothing shops, it can do things like offer try-on, pickup and returns of online apparel at local stores. Amazon, on the other hand, doesn’t have a clothing retail presence. But maybe that’s next, given how quickly these two are matching each others’ moves.",

        "Amazon, eBay, Walmart and Etsy have all struggled to curb price gouging and products that make unverified claims about the coronavirus..CNBC found several examples of face masks and \"survival kits\" that made dubious claims about their ability to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. .Third-party sellers continue to gouge prices of hand sanitizers, face masks, hazmat suits and other products. .With many products sold out in stores, shoppers are racing to online retailers to order face masks, hand sanitizer, hazmat suits and other items to protect against the coronavirus..The surge in demand has created an opening for third-party sellers on various e-commerce sites like . and . to offer products that are otherwise sold out at traditional retailers. But in doing so, some merchants have flooded online marketplaces with overpriced goods and items that make dubious medical marketing claims. CNBC found products like face masks with markups as high as 582%..Meanwhile, online retailers are playing a game of whack-a-mole to remove listings making misleading claims about the coronavirus or overcharging for products that have spiked in demand. Amazon, for example, said last week that it removed more than 1 million products for violating its policies related to price gouging and coronavirus claims. But plenty of listings still show up across various online shopping sites..Shoppers are .. As of Tuesday, there were more than .. There are at least 91 confirmed or presumptive positive cases of the coronavirus in the U.S, and at least six deaths..Amazon, ., eBay and .are among the online platforms that have been hit with price gouging or misleading medical products. All of the companies say that this activity isn't allowed on their platforms and that they've removed listings or suspended sellers that violate their policies. But CNBC was able to find examples of products that appeared to flout these rules, illustrating that the problem still persists..Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . it was monitoring the market for any products that make fraudulent coronavirus prevention and treatment claims. The agency said it would issue \"warning letters, seizures or injunctions against products on the market that are not in compliance with the law.\".Consumers have snapped up surgical masks out of fear of catching the coronavirus, even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . people who are well wear a mask. Third-party sellers on several platforms have exploited this fear by incorrectly marketing face masks with specific keywords such as \"coronavirus face mask\" or \"N95 face mask,\" referring to a specific type of respirator that keeps out small airborne particles..Rocio Zamora, an Amazon Prime member, experienced this firsthand. Earlier this month, Zamora purchased a box of . from a third-party seller, so that she could protect herself from germs while visiting her sick son in the hospital, she told CNBC. The masks cost about $20, but the seller charged Zamora $100 to ship the item via standard delivery from Houston to her New York City-area residence..When the item arrived, she opened the box and discovered the masks weren't N95 respirators, but masks \"used for construction,\" Zamora said. She returned the masks but Amazon wasn't able to issue her a refund. Amazon has since taken down the listing and told Zamora it would investigate why the seller charged her $100 for shipping. The seller, Spoon n Fork, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment..Last week, Amazon . it took down more than 1 million products from its third-party marketplace for making unverified claims about the coronavirus. The marketplace, which accounts for more than half of the company's retail volume, is made up of millions of third-party merchants who offer products, new and used, from all over the world that they purchase from official distributors, flea markets and clearance aisles..Amazon also sent out a notice to European sellers warning against mentioning the terms \"Covid-19\" and \"Coronavirus\" in their listings, according to a document obtained by CNBC. \"In this situation, we invite you to behave in good faith and to keep customers' trust, as well as to comply with the Business Solutions agreement and Amazon policies,\" the notice states..Earlier this month, CNBC . several examples of third-party sellers offering products that claimed to \"kill\" the coronavirus, which were later flagged by Amazon's algorithms. Many of the products were not certified to kill the strain of coronavirus that's currently spreading, but could protect against other strains of the virus. After the sellers removed the claims, some of their listings were reinstated..Jed Nelsen, a senior compliance manager at etailz, which helps brands sell on Amazon, Walmart and eBay, said he's been advising sellers to be careful about what claims they make on coronavirus-related products. If sellers can't prove their product does what they say it does, Nelson said they should steer clear of claiming their product kills or prevents transmission of the new coronavirus..\"There's a lot of sellers who don't have the backing or understanding about what they can and can't say about disinfectants,\" Nelsen said. \"We're trying to mitigate the risk to consumers in that way.\".EBay has also faced similar issues with sellers looking to capitalize on consumer fears about the coronavirus. An eBay spokesperson told CNBC that the company has taken down more than 20,000 products for making unsubstantiated health claims about the coronavirus..\"On our marketplace, eBay has been employing a combination of digital and manual surveillance tools to remove products marketed with the term 'coronavirus,' which violates our policies regarding making unsubstantiated health claims,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are also taking action to mitigate the inflated price of masks listed on the site.\".The company also . out to sellers reminding them of its listing policies and warning against misuse of keywords like \"Coronavirus,\" \"Covid-19,\" \"Virus\" and \"epidemic.\" The notice, which also warns against price gouging, says eBay will remove listings, lower seller ratings and suspend a seller's account, among other actions, if it finds products that violate its policies..Despite the crackdown, the platform still hosts its fair share of face masks with . claims, some of which have been removed since CNBC first identified them. There's also plenty of examples of .and . on eBay. A listing for a hat, which eBay has since removed, claimed it would \"prevent droplet transmission...of any virus\" and mentioned coronavirus in the product description, which violates eBay's policies. Users also posted on eBay community forums with . about ...Alibaba last month announced a similar crackdown on dubious face masks. The company announced in a . Feb. 4 that it had intercepted and removed 570,000 masks of questionable problems..Other platforms, including Walmart and Etsy, said they'd removed products with misleading medical claims. An Etsy spokesperson told CNBC that it has removed \"thousands of items with medical claims that violate our policies,\" including those that claim to protect against the coronavirus, over the past few days. A Walmart spokesperson said the company is continuing to monitor the site for products that make unsubstantiated medical claims, but declined to share data on how many products it has removed so far..As supply has diminished, the price of hand sanitizer, face masks, disinfectants, hazmat suits, gloves and other products has skyrocketed. Many online platforms have distributed notices to sellers warning them not to gouge prices. Others have removed listings or suspended sellers who fail to follow the rules..Amazon has suspended or removed tens of thousands of deals from sellers that it accused of charging customers unfair prices, the company said last week. Walmart and Etsy told CNBC that they're taking down listings with inflated prices, while eBay said it's complying with local price gouging laws and removing masks that are \"priced 10x above the standard price of approximately 75 cents a piece.\" The companies didn't provide specific data on how many listings have been suspended or removed for price gouging..On Amazon, the price of face masks and hazmat suits has surged. According to ., which creates product research software for Amazon sellers, the average price of DuPont hazmat suits has risen 13% from $9.68 to $11.08, though the site had suits listed as high as $23.37. CNBC found one . for a DuPont hazmat suit priced at $64.99..The average price of N95 face masks has gone up even more. Before Amazon ran out of stock, N95 face masks were priced at $13.28, but Jungle Scout found prices have since spiked 582% to $63.95. Sellers are also gouging prices of disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer, with a . sanitizer priced at $30..There are numerous examples of price gouging on other platforms as well. A . face masks is currently available on eBay for as much as $148, while . 2.5-ounce Germ-X hand sanitizer bottles costs $500..On Walmart's marketplace, CNBC found a listing for a 50-pack of Halyard surgical masks priced at $50 and 10 boxes of 50 disposable masks for $80. Both were removed from the site after CNBC asked Walmart about the listings. .Meanwhile, on Etsy, a package of 20 Gerson N95 masks was $75 and 20 N95 Moldex masks were $250. The listings were removed after CNBC asked Etsy about them..Price gouging isn't a new phenomenon on the web, but it's likely to continue as the coronavirus spreads. Amazon faced complaints of price gouging during Hurricane Irma in 2017, when customers complained of sharply inflated prices for essentials like bottled water. .In some cases, sellers who inflate prices may not just be violating a site's policies.

Beth Hall/Handout via REUTERS  .LOS ANGELES, May 19 (Reuters) - Walmart and Target are testing their own home package delivery services in the United States - stealing a page from Amazon's play book - as e-commerce demand strains traditional carriers like United Parcel Service, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service..The move is just the latest example of how Walmart Inc . and Target Corp . are working to close the gap with Amazon.com Inc ., the No. 1 online retailer. Amazon has recruited armies of small businesses to provide delivery services from vans emblazoned with the company's logo - an effort that has helped it control customer wait times and costs..UPS ., FedEx Corp . and the USPS have been inundated with packages since the coronavirus pandemic hit U.S. shores last year - forcing retailers to seek new ways to get goods into the hands of customers while containing soaring delivery costs..Walmart - a key FedEx delivery customer - has been trialing its first company-branded \"last-mile\" delivery vans, John Furner, Walmart's U.S. chief executive, said on the company's earnings call on Tuesday..Since January, a small, electric van fleet has made package deliveries in the Bentonville and Rogers areas near Walmart's Arkansas headquarters, company spokeswoman Camille Dunn said. The drivers work for Walmart, which also employs its semi-truck drivers..When asked about Walmart's project, shipping consultant Cathy Morrow Roberson said: \"Hallelujah. They can afford to build out a last-mile delivery network. They built out a trucking network.\".Keeping package delivery operations in-house could give Walmart an advantage, said Roberson, founder of Logistics Trends & Insights..\"I wouldn't say that they get customers away from Amazon, but they can certainly put up a good fight,\" she said..Retailers are dealing with a trucker shortage that threatens their ability to stock their stores. However, van drivers in theory should be easier to find because they don't require professional licenses like big-rig drivers do..Target so far is depending on independent drivers from Shipt, which it bought in 2017..The retailer earlier this year began testing home package delivery from a new sorting center in its hometown of Minneapolis. Workers in that center group packages by zone and hand some over to drivers for Shipt, who use their own cars for deliveries..The effort, which is fortified by acquired technology from transport management provider Grand Junction and delivery firm Deliv, aims to \"add capacity, reduce costs and enable more flexibility,\" Target Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan said on a conference call on Wednesday..Walmart, Target and Amazon use gig workers to make same-day,  local deliveries.

In the first half of 2019 alone, . has been spent in healthcare-related venture capital. But nothing draws more attention than when a giant consumer brand -- with universal name recognition and undying consumer loyalty -- shows clear signs of entering the healthcare industry.  In recent months, as brands like Amazon and WalMart announced partnerships and mergers with healthcare entities, speculation reached a fever pitch:  What were these partnerships for? Would these companies launch services for their employees, their consumers, or both? .Some answers have begun to emerge in the past month. WalMart opened a new primary care clinic in Georgia, ., that also offers services in dentistry and behavioral health. The company is also expanding their . education benefit program for employees to include “seven bachelor’s degrees and two career diplomas in health-related fields for $1 a day.”  With an eye towards the forecasted growth of healthcare jobs in the next 10 years, WalMart is helping employees get a head start.  The program is also expected to help WalMart provide affordable and accessible healthcare within their communities.  This multi-faceted approach towards disrupting the healthcare industry even includes a consumer-focused ., available through Sam’s Club, for dental care, generic prescriptions, and telehealth consultations. While not intended to replace health insurance, the bundles can help community members with increasing out-of-pocket expenses, particularly in high-deductible plans. Walmart’s stated goal for all of these moves: to help make “healthcare more affordable and accessible for customers in the communities we serve.”.Meanwhile, Amazon’s latest move is to launch . – a “new virtual health service benefit for employees and their families in the Seattle region.” AmazonCare is multi-modal, allowing employees to access virtual and in-person healthcare services from its partner, Washington-based Oasis Medical Group P.C. The service is being offered in conjunction with new on-site primary care clinics in the company’s Seattle headquarters. These offerings are consistent with other healthcare moves Amazon has made, including establishing Haven with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway and acquiring PillPack – all of which have potential to cause significant disruption in the healthcare market..\n.As many employers struggle to control health cost growth while ensuring that employees have access to affordable care, it’s important to remain open to what these nontraditional players can bring to the fight.  Amazon and WalMart built their brands on offering consumers lower cost and greater convenience, and they have the same goals for their healthcare offerings. But they are but two examples of many new entrants and new services in health care delivery.  As new opportunities emerge, consider everything you know about your population and what would have the greatest impact on how they currently access health care (or not) and how they take care of themselves (or not). Healthcare is very personal, so some of these offerings will be a better fit than others.  With a growing marketplace of services to choose from, you don’t have to be WalMart or Amazon to make a difference in your employees’ lives. .\n.Solution Architect, Center for Health Innovation.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n",

        "By ., contributing writer...Walmart has been investing billions of dollars to revamp and improve its ecommerce capabilities to better compete with Amazon.  Since 2012, the project – dubbed Pangaea – has reworked the retailer’s website and built new cloud infrastructure, data centers, and a search engine, all in the hopes of luring customers away from their online competitors..Jeremy King, chief technology officer of Wal-Mart’s global e-commerce operation,  . that Pangaea was a chance to rearrange the world’s biggest company. Mr. King’s team has basically rebuilt the retailer’s ecommerce capabilities from top to bottom, including how the website works and looks, underlying transaction software, databases and servers, and the backend data center tools to manage it all. The team also built new cloud infrastructure and data centers and wrote its own search engine..“Pangaea replaces everything,” says Mr. King, in an interview. “My peers, they think I’m out of my mind. Most people don’t replace entire systems in one shot, especially with from-scratch development,” he says. “But given how rapidly this place is changing, we didn’t have time to screw around.”.As part of project Pangaea, Walmart has acquired 15 tech companies and employed more than 3,600 tech employees at its Silicon Valley center. . that it would open its OneOps cloud-storage solution to the public, making it easier to move data between cloud systems, an answer to Amazon’s formidable cloud operations, which support much of the web..In 2014, Walmart CEO Doug McMillion credited Amazon with leading the world in ., “Clearly, Amazon is teaching the world what’s possible,” though he also asserted that brick-and-mortar stores were not going anywhere. .According to ., e-commerce will gain more ground than any other segment of the retail industry by 2017, with a compound annual growth rate of 11 percent each year. Supercenters come in second, with their growth rate projected at only about half that of web shopping. And sales for consumer packaged goods online — food, groceries, everyday items — are almost 20 percent, the chief source of Walmart’s drive to build ecommerce..But some critics say that Walmart can’t beat Amazon at the ecommerce game.  ., Walmart faces six obstacles to winning the battle for online customers:.Amazon’s singular focus on ecommerce..Logistics and delivery. While Walmart is a king when it comes to logistics, Amazon dominates with its delivery services. .Agile innovation. Amazon has always thought like a start-up innovation company, allowing it to be creative and fresh; Walmart tries to think like a start-up with the Walmart Labs division, but the legacy business and its mindset are weighing the innovation down..Customer set differences. Walmart is handicapped by its demographics, a quarter of whom do not use debit or credit cards or even have a bank account. .Existing in-store strategies..Technology lead. Basically, “Walmart must transform itself into an invisible personal shopper to help customers navigate its vast inventory.”.Ultimately, Digital Spark Marketing concludes, “At the end of the day, Walmart’s rise to online dominance really just revolves around turning an otherwise complicated shopping experience into one that feels quaint and easy. It can accomplish this by setting up a strong behind-the-scenes infrastructure that puts the customer experience at the forefront.”.\n.\n.Get the latest trends, news, and insights",

        "Logistics is becoming the battleground for retailers looking to compete with Amazon..Over the last year, both Walmart.com and eBay have partnered with third-party logistics providers to compete with Amazon’s two-day shipping standard; both marketplaces are also working with installation services, with eBay working with Handy, Porch and Installernet, and Walmart with Handy and Porch. The goal is to match Amazon on delivery while adding additional value through in-home help. Providers are bullish on their capabilities to drive conversion for retailers and help build logistics infrastructure that would otherwise be too costly for retailers. But others say they’re test cases before larger brands decide on acquisitions or the development of in-house capabilities..Two-year-old Deliverr, which works with Walmart, eBay, Etsy, and Shopify, uses a tech platform that connects sellers with a network of warehouses and logistics providers so they can offer two-day delivery..“[Merchants] can send inventory to multiple places, and Deliverr can activate any channel, whether it’s Walmart, eBay, Shopify, or Amazon,” said Deliverr co-founder Harish Abbott, in an interview at the National Retail Federation’s Big Show on Monday. “[Sellers] don’t have that network.”.Similarly, installation startups are working with marketplaces that compete with Amazon..“.Walmart recently . that tie-ups with companies like Handy offer customers added convenience. Andrew Lipsman, retail and e-commerce analyst at eMarketer, said moves to tie-up third-party logistics providers are evidence these companies are in a test phase to figure out whether in-house capabilities make sense..“Walmart and eBay are both in experimentation mode and trying to figure out what works,” he said. “For the partnerships that pay off, I think they’re definitely willing to acquire if the case and opportunity present itself. Walmart [acquired] Parcel and you can bet there will eventually be more logistics acquisitions down the road.” Target’s Shipt acquisition is another example of this, but as CEO Brian Cornell said at the National Retail Federation Big Show on Monday, it’s a move that was motivated by the enhanced customer service that Shipt’s personal shopper service offers..Others say outsourcing will continue in some form, especially given that it’s not possible for Amazon’s competitors to replicate its logistics machine..“It’s important to point out that owning and operating this line of business isn’t core to e-commerce-first players, like eBay,” said Caroline Klatt, CEO and co-founder of . Labs.. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.Fashion marketers are working overtime to understand what's next — including supply chain and sustainability..\n.\n.\n.Allowing retailers to sell for free, and adding more payment options, makes Google itself more of a shopping tool..\n.\n.\n.If a consumer sees something they like, they can click on the product and will be taken out to the LG website to complete their purchase..\n.\n.\n.On top of the impending cookie deprecation, Apple’s recent iOS 15 changes are causing concern for many advertisers by affecting pixels, IP addresses and email addresses.  While these upcoming changes may be concerning for many, shifting mindsets and getting away from a binary way of thinking with solutions being 100% contextual or 100% universal IDs […].\n.\n.\n.Brands were forced to find ways to reach customers in their homes and fast-food restaurants, including McDonald’s and Burger King, found answers by investing in loyalty programs..\n.\n.\n.Etsy is still growing beyond a blast of mask sales last year and now needs to manage 4.7 million sellers and 90 million buyers..\n.\n"
