In the UK, 33 per cent of online retail is conducted through Amazon. This makes Amazon the fifth biggest retailer in the UK, just behind the big supermarkets. The point is that, now we know Amazon is moving into the tyre space, anything that is happening in the US has resonance in the UK market as well.","twitter:data1":"Chris","twitter:data2":"5 minutes","article:modified_time":"2018-10-04T15:22:42+00:00","viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1","og:locale":"en_GB","og:url":"https://www.tyrepress.com/2018/10/amazons-increasingly-influential-role-in-tyre-sales/"}],"cse_image":[{"src":"https://www.tyrepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Amazon_logo_plain.png"}],"listitem":[{"name":"Home","position":"1","url":"Home"},{"name":"News","position":"2","url":"News"},{"name":"Company News","position":"3","url":"Company News"}]}}]},"3":{"kind":"customsearch#search","url":{"type":"application/json","template":"https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?q={searchTerms}&num={count?}&start={startIndex?}&lr={language?}&safe={safe?}&cx={cx?}&sort={sort?}&filter={filter?}&gl={gl?}&cr={cr?}&googlehost={googleHost?}&c2coff={disableCnTwTranslation?}&hq={hq?}&hl={hl?}&siteSearch={siteSearch?}&siteSearchFilter={siteSearchFilter?}&exactTerms={exactTerms?}&excludeTerms={excludeTerms?}&linkSite={linkSite?}&orTerms={orTerms?}&relatedSite={relatedSite?}&dateRestrict={dateRestrict?}&lowRange={lowRange?}&highRange={highRange?}&searchType={searchType}&fileType={fileType?}&rights={rights?}&imgSize={imgSize?}&imgType={imgType?}&imgColorType={imgColorType?}&imgDominantColor={imgDominantColor?}&alt=json"},"queries":{"previousPage":[{"title":"Google Custom Search - \"such as Amazon * or OR and\"","totalResults":"7570000000","searchTerms":"\"such as Amazon * or OR and\"","count":10,"startIndex":11,"inputEncoding":"utf8","outputEncoding":"utf8","safe":"active","cx":"aaab32314809a8355"}],"request":[{"title":"Google Custom Search - \"such as Amazon * or OR and\"","totalResults":"7570000000","searchTerms":"\"such as Amazon * or OR and\"","count":10,"startIndex":21,"inputEncoding":"utf8","outputEncoding":"utf8","safe":"active","cx":"aaab32314809a8355"}],"nextPage":[{"title":"Google Custom Search - \"such as Amazon * or OR and\"","totalResults":"7570000000","searchTerms":"\"such as Amazon * or OR and\"","count":10,"startIndex":31,"inputEncoding":"utf8","outputEncoding":"utf8","safe":"active","cx":"aaab32314809a8355"}]},"context":{"title":"maldar"},"searchInformation":{"searchTime":0.371117,"formattedSearchTime":"0.37","totalResults":"7570000000","formattedTotalResults":"7,570,000,000"},"items":[{"kind":"customsearch#result","title":"Event discusses childhood and youth in the Amazon","htmlTitle":"Event discusses childhood and youth in the Amazon","link":"https://ppgsa.propesp.ufpa.br/index.php/en/program/news/all-news/105-event-discusses-childhood-and-youth-in-the-amazon","displayLink":"ppgsa.propesp.ufpa.br","snippet":"Nov 13, 2015 ...
