              "articleBody": "+++lead-in-text\n\nEngineers recently tested a new way of sending information across a trans-Atlantic internet cable, showing it could push two-and-a-half-times more data through this pipe than current methods. They claim the tests set a record for this kind of intercontinental connection, a key component of the modern internet. But the record isn't as interesting as who ran the test: Facebook.\n\n+++\n\nUsing hardware designed by researchers at Bell Labs---the iconic R&D shop now owned by Nokia---Facebook ran these tests across optical fiber it owns inside an undersea cable called [America Europe Connect](http://www.aquacomms.com/networks/aec-america-europe-connect), which stretches from New York to Ireland. \"Experiments commissioned by Facebook are setting records. That's something new,\" says Jonathan Kahn, a Stanford University engineering professor who specializes in optical communications.\n\n+++inset-left\n\n+++sidebar\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/592667f87034dc5f91beb4de]\n\n\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/592667fa8d4ebc5ab806a27f]\n\n\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/592667fccefba457b0799dcc]\n\n+++\n\n+++\n\nBut at the same time, these tests represent the latest development in a much larger trend. The internet's biggest names---Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook---are all working to accelerate the evolution of the internet itself, pushing past the companies that traditionally built, deployed, and operated the infrastructure that underpins the global network. AT&T didn't show off this new optical transmission technology, based on a technique called [probabilistic constellation shaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_shaping). The world's largest social network did. \"The industry---like ourselves and Google---is trying to drive the technology as far a possible,\" says Stephen Grubb, a global optical network architect at Facebook who previously worked at Bell Labs.\n\nFacebook and Google have long pushed in this general direction, because it's the only way they can continue to rapidly expand their already massive online empires. When they outgrew the computers and other data center hardware that served up their services, [they built their own](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/facebook-got-even-apple-back-open-source-hardware/). Once they saturated online markets in the developed world, they started building [high-altitude balloons](https://www.wired.com/2015/06/google-testing-balloons-giant-air-force-freezer/), [drones](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/inside-facebooks-first-efforts-rain-internet-sky/), and [wireless antennas](https://www.wired.com/2016/04/facebooks-massive-new-antennas-can-beam-internet-miles/) to make the internet accessible in entirely new locations. And as they pushed more and more data across the globe, they started investing in their own [intercontinental cables](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/facebook-microsoft-laying-giant-cable-across-atlantic/).\n\n### Pushing Data\nNow, as it bets big on video and explores early forms of VR, Facebook is looking for ways of sending increasingly larger amounts of data across these cables. Less than fifteen months ago, Facebook purchased a certain amount of bandwidth on the AEC cable, which spans more than 3,400-miles. But its experiments with Nokia show that it can dramatically increase how much information it sends through the same amount of fiber, creating more bandwidth than it purchased.\n\nKahn calls the company's tests technically impressive, and he says they point to a larger change in telecom research. \"Companies like Google and Facebook are really reshaping telecommunications,\" he says. \"The needs of those companies are really driving the whole telecom R&D enterprise---very significantly---and they're perhaps going to overshadow the needs of telecom companies.\"\n\nThis change could have several knock-on effects. For one, it could shift the role of research organizations and hardware makers that have traditionally designed telecommunications gear. Increasingly, these operations must design for internet giants like Google and Facebook, not just the entrenched telecoms. And that could push them to move at a much faster pace. Case in point: Nokia, one of the major suppliers of such telecom hardware, is working directly with Facebook to push optical communications to new heights.\n\nThese hardware companies may also lose some of their grip on the market, because Google and Facebook often build their own hardware infrastructure. That's not what's going on with Facebook's trans-Atlantic tests. But the company has designed everything from servers to wireless antennas in the past. Its tests on the AEC cable involved Nokia prototypes running alongside its own lasers.\n\nAll this work means that in the years to come, Google and Facebook and other internet giants will deliver far more complex applications to you far more quickly. And many other online businesses could reach similar heights. After, Nokia could sell its bandwidth-pumping hardware to a wider market. What's more, Facebook has worked for years to freely share its infrastructure ideas and designs with the world at large. Through a new organization called the Telecom Infrastructure Project, it encourages others in the industry to do the same with their telecommunications hardware.\n\nSuch sharing only stands to reason. After all, a better internet is better for Facebook. Lucky for you, a better internet is also a better internet.",

Here we expand on this existing body of work by addressing a Facebook page, Ask the Chicks, themed around questions and answers related to motherhood. Using the uses and gratification lens, we explore motivations for participation as they relate to engagement with the page.</p><h3>Materials and methods</h3><p>Individuals were recruited to participant in an online survey through posts on the Ask the Chicks Facebook page made by the page owner over a 1-week period. To be eligible to complete the survey, participants had to be 18 years old or older, female, and pregnant or have at least one child under the age of 5 years.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Analyses of survey data collected from users of the page (n=647) revealed that engagement has a positive relationship with the motives of relaxing entertainment, expressive in",

But sadly, despite this positive attribute, it has had negative consequences, especially among the young people who are using facebook to abuse others as they engage in unpalatable and abusive language against each other. I take great sense of relief and admiration with some of the groups such as 'Small Scale Farmers (Farming as Business)' which has dedicated itself to sharing very vital information on how to develop their farms. The forum is a complete business model from produce to transporters and the market. I am of the opinion that we should spend most of our time on social media for sharing development information regardless of our political affiliation and without resorting to abusive language. It is from such well-organised groups that government can even take interest and assemble them as cooperatives and attract some form of small loans for expansion. Have a great day.",
