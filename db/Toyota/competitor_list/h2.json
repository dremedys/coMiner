Both the\nmanufacturer and supplier can influence product quality and consequentially\nshare costs of product failures. Rich theoretical results under the principal agent\nmodel framework have been accumulated in the last two decades, but empirical evidence\non whether the Stackelberg’s leadership game truly imitates practical supply\nchain relationship remains unfound. We study the domestic automobile industry\nin the last decade and provides to our best knowledge the first empirical\nevidence to assess the validity and practicality of principal agent theory and draw\nthe implications of principal agent theory on supply chain relationship costs.\nOur empirical results suggest that Japanese OEMs behave more like principal\nagent theory suggests than the US OEMs in general and thus gain significant\nbenefits in terms of marginal effort costs in motivating suppliers’ quality\ni",
